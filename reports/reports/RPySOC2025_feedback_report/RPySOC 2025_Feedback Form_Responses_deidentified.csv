The keynotes were excellent, especially Cara and Ben.
The venue was lovely and the food, and it was really easy to get to from the Tube. In some ways Birmingham is cheaper easier and more central but it did fell really exciting to be in London especially being near Oxford Street for the social, in the lead up to Christmas. I think tit would be great to be there agin next year if we can be. The AV worked really well, except for a couple of hitches which were probably more to do with the presenter's laptops than the venue?? Being back in Birmingham next year would also be great though.

It's very rare, and therefore precious, to have the opportunity to learn deep technical detail from highly knowledgable people with experience of getting things done with data in the NHS. 

Everyone is friendly, easy to talk to and open to ideas, which makes for very enjoyable and energising conversations. In years of conference-going, I have rarely found one where ideas and knowledge flow so freely as they do within the NHS Open Analytics community. 

As the content directly addresses challenges that data scientists tackle every day in the NHS, it is highly relevant and valuable to everyday work that I and others are doing. 

This combination - inspiring, practical content, enjoyable and easy conversation, and laser focus on the specifics of the NHS - is unique.

Here's what I shared on my way home:

On a delayed train back to Edinburgh after the NHS-OA conference. Worth the trek down to London and back? Absolutely!

Here are some highlights that are only possible because it was in person:

 Informal chats with folks over coffees and lunches, being able to help each other out and overhearing those ""can I try it out in my trust and maybe that will help us build something more generalisable to others?"" conversations

?? Those ""how was your dinner with your friends?"" / ""did you manage to resolve that tricky situation?"" moments of human connection that are so much harder to do online

 The Unconference sessions where we explored ideas that just came out of all those conversations

This conference is so important, creating community for analysts who are essentially all on the same team but scattered around the country. And I think we all left with plenty of things to look up and apply in our own contexts!

Keep up the good work - it's pretty amazing

Having a community-led stream like this with opportunities for deeper chats with people who have a shared interest in a particular problem feels like it provides a great opportunity for helping ideas and solutions to germinate. It makes a big difference to have this running near to the main event - I didn't attend any in 2023 due to the challenges of getting to the sessions, but in 2024 and this year, I attended a large number of sessions and really valued the insights of the other participants.",Yes,Very likely,-,How practical the things talked about are,"I found the sign-up process a little confusing this year.

Year after year, I come away with a long list of useful things to try out. 

If this event were to move to virtual only, it would be a huge loss to the open analytics community. Writing code in the NHS is often quite an isolated experience, with many people being the only person in their organisation, or one of a handful, who are flying the flag for open analytics and better use of data. There is nothing else in the calendar that does such a good job of allowing analysts and others to share ideas, improve their practice, and grow their network.",-,-,-,-,Slack,"Yes, I agree to share my data."

The NHS R community is supportive, passionate and very welcoming to newcomers, which I've really benefited from. I've come away from the conference with tangible pieces of knowledge that I will now apply in my NHS role, and also a more general sense of optimism that many brilliant people are doing good data science with open-source tools to help NHS patients.

However, I do appreciate this is in the nature and colleagues running sessions would likely not mind people hopping up and leaving as they settle in. Really enjoyed all the sessions though and happy I did stay.
