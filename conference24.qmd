![](img/rpysoc-24-banner.png){fig-alt="RPySoc conference 2024 banner."}

21 and 22 November 2024, Hall 11, [ICC Birmingham](https://www.theicc.co.uk/)

The two open source communities, NHS-R Community and NHS.pycom, are hosting an in-person and virtually streamed annual conference we've called RPySOC (incorporating R, Py from Python and using the initials for Open Source Conference). We will have over 120 people in person with as many as double or triple that online. Both in person and virtual attendees are invited to post Q&As and have discussions with peers in our NHS-R Community Slack and which is available throughout the year for technical support, sharing useful information and connecting with others in our profession. 
 
We have R and Python talks throughout two days in lightning (10 minutes) and plenary (20 minutes) slots and we will also have an in person event called an unconference, introduced to us through colleagues at The University of Edinburgh, which runs alongside the talks. This is where attendees put forward suggestions for discussion which others sign up to.

Talks will be recorded and shared on YouTube and slides made available in our [conference-2024 repo](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/conference-2024).

## Tickets

In-person attendance - full, but please email us at [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net) to join the waiting list. 

Virtual attendance - tickets are available by completing this [form](https://forms.office.com/e/NBcjv7LVJ4).

## Slack

We will be using a dedicated conference channel #in-person-conference-talks on Slack to take questions for our speakers. Last year this allowed both in-person and virtual attendees to ask questions and inspired discussions that lasted beyond the conference. 

There will also be an unconference channel: #unconferencing-session.

A link to join the NHS-R community Slack channel can be found in our [postcard](https://postcard.nhsrcommunity.com/). More details on how we use Slack can be found in the [NHS-R Way](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/community-handbook.html#slack).

## Unconference

The unconference was a popular addition to the conference last year. People came forward with ideas and questions inspiring some great discussions on topics ranging from Quarto to statistical tests to NHS-R Community branding. We will be trying out unconferencing again and look forward to seeing you there.

Day one - we will take suggestions for informal group discussions which people can vote for or say they can turn up to.

Day two - we will split the room so that people can move between the speaker sessions and the unconference. 

For more information on unconferencing we have a [podcast talk](https://nhsrcommunity.substack.com/p/nhs-r-podcast-14th-december-unconferences-6da?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) with Pawel Orzechowski from the University of Edinburgh who introduced the idea of unconferencing to us and a [blog](blog/what-was-the-unconference.qmd) by Ben Murch on how it went at the 2023 conference.
