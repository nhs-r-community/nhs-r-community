title: "Page is missing (404)"
---

The page you expected might have been removed or renamed. 

If you were following a link like <https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/#event_type-conferences>
this was an original search from the WordPress site. 
By removing the text from `#` onwards it might go to the right page.

Alternatively use the Quarto site search in the top right (the magnifier) to 
try to locate the correct content. 

Do let us know of any broken links or missing pages by raising a GitHub issue or 
emailing. Details can be found on the [Contact](./contact.qmd) page.
