(tip)\nBy following these instructions you will have created a new branch in your repository so the PR (pull request) will go automatically to your own repository's `main` branch. \nYou can either complete this which updates your `main` or redirect the PR in GitHub to the original NHS-R Community repository which will be possible as the two are linked.\n:::\n\n### Blog submissions\n\nIf you are writing a blog and are submitting this through a Pull Request in GitHub, please save a `.qmd` file into the folder called `blog` and any images you've used in the `img` subfolder.\nAlso ensure that all images used have suitable [alternative text as good practice](https://design102.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/14/whats-the-alternative-how-to-write-good-alt-text/) and this will need to be a short description of the image.\n\nThe format for the header part of the `.qmd` YAML template is often set out like this:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Your title here\"\ndate: \"17 October 2022\"\ndate-modified: \"27 July 2024\"\ncategories:\n  - Something\n  - Something Else\nauthor: Your name\nimage: img/picture.jpg\nimage-alt: \"Please add a short description\"\nsubtitle: >\n  \"Please add a short description of the blog if you'd like or remove this text\"\n---\n```\nThe default for all blogs' YAML is:\n\n```\nexecute:\n  `eval: true\n   echo: true\n```\n\nso is not necessary in the blogs themselves.\nHowever, if you wish to change the default so the blog, for example, shows code but does not run it then the YAML needs the following added to the individual blog `.qmd` YAML:\n\n```\nexecute: \n  eval: false\n```\n\nMore details on the [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) are available from the Quarto documentation website.\n\n### Website creation\n\nYou only need to submit the `.qmd` file and any images as the repository will recreate the book online using GitHub Actions once the Pull Request has been accepted.\nHowever, you can still view the website locally to see if everything works by running the R code with the {quarto} package loaded:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquarto::quarto_render()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}\n## Building the website localled (warning)\nViewing the blog locally can take time as it builds several pages for the website and will create other files like `.html` as well as update the `site_libs` folder files.\n\nWhen submitting an Pull Request none of these newly generated files are required.\n:::\n\n### YouTube\n\nWe have nearly 200 videos on YouTube and although subtitles are automatically added by YouTube these require tidying so if you want to watch and correct text as you go along we'd welcome your help to improve the videos and make them more accessible.\n\nWe use Clipchamp which is a free video editing program provided by Microsoft.\n\nVideos may also benefit from video chapters being added and notes on where to find resources that are referred to in the video. \nSometimes people add these into the comments and that's very welcome!\n\n### Podcasts\n\nWe have podcasts on Soundcloud and although these have been mostly hosted by Chris Beeley, can be hosted by anyone.\n\nThese are also being copied to YouTube so that subtitles can be added and, like the videos, often need corrections.\n\n### NHS-R Community Committee\n\nThe NHS-R Community Committee meets regularly and details of what the Committee do and how to get involved is in our [NHS-Way book](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/nhsr-committee.html).\n\n### Coffee and Coding\n\nWe have a regular [coffee and coding](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/Coffee_and_code.html) meeting where you can bring a question, some code you need help with or just come along to hear how about others' work.\n\n## Practising coding\n\nNo matter where you are in your journey learning open source coding tools NHS-R Community welcomes contributions to the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/nhs-r-community) where we have Quarto books, a website, R packages and training materials.\nThis is an area for practising techniques as we don't hold sensitive data.\n\nProjects across our account use R, git, GitHub actions, [Docker](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/r_gh_actions), [R universe](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/nhs-r-community.r-universe.dev). \nNo project is \"finished\" and improvements can always be suggested, Pull Requests made and direct access given (where appropriate and agreed).\n\n### Finding good first issues\n\nGitHub has the facility to label or \"tag\" issues and this can help with searching for suitable open issues to work on or contribute to in the conversation.\nWe use various labels on NHS-R GitHub repositories and to get started:\n\n[help wanted](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Anhs-r-community+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&type=issues)\n\n[good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Anhs-r-community+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&type=issues)\n\n[documentation](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Anhs-r-community+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22documentation%22&type=issues)\n\n### Tidying repositories\n\nStandardisation of projects has started with READMEs with templates for text in the [NHS-R Way](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#readmes-in-repositories) and shared resources like logos kept in an [asset](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/assets) repository.\n\nFurther tidying will be needed with licences, protection of main branches and [recognising all contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors).\n\n### New projects\n\nWe have many repositories and ongoing projects but if you have a project you'd like to start or share with us we are happy to host these too.\nWe just ask that anything that is passed to our repository is open under the MIT or CC0 [licences](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#licences-to-use) and if you've used something else to just get in touch about it.\n\n## Teaching and sharing\n\nNHS-R Community hosts very popular, free, [workshops and webinars](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/get-involved.html) throughout the year.\n\nAll our materials are free to use, copy and change and we publish all our [joining instructions](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/training.html).\n\nAnswer queries posted in help-with-r channel of the [Slack](https://postcard.nhsrcommunity.com/)\n",
