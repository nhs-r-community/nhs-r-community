This data often receives media attention because cold weather and seasonal illnesses can lead to higher demand for hospital care, meaning that services might be under increased pressure. At the [Health Foundation](https://www.health.org.uk/), one of our aims is to provide new insight into the quality of health care through in-depth analysis of policy and data. So, to understand more about the current demand for hospital care and the challenges the NHS is facing, [we keep a close eye on the latest seasonal trends](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/the-nhs-this-winter-looking-beneath-the-national-view).\n\n**Keeping on top of NHS winter indicators has the potential to keep us analysts busy.** The raw data is published in a fairly complex spreadsheet, requires a decent amount of cleaning and needs to be reanalysed after every release. In addition to monitoring national figures, this winter our team at the Health Foundation also wanted to see if there might be any variation between different areas of England. Sustainability and transformation partnerships (STPs) are areas where health and care leaders develop shared proposals for local services. Therefore, we enriched the raw data with information about where hospitals are located, and which STP they belong to. But with a similar analytical approach, more fine-grained local structures (such as [Clinical Commissioning Groups]()) could be used.\n\n::: aside\nOriginal link to STPs page has moved. Original link shared <https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/stps/view-stps/>\n:::\n\nFor a **more efficient and reproducible way of tracking NHS winter indicators** this year, we moved to our whole analysis pipeline to R. We then used the clean data for visualisations in R and other applications, like Tableau. This blog takes you through our analysis workflow and describes how we got through some tricky steps. The complete R script is also available on GitHub, if you want to give it a go yourself. You can also read a [blog](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/the-nhs-this-winter-looking-beneath-the-national-view) on the Health Foundation's website to find out why we looked at local areas this year and what we found.\n\n::: aside\nOriginal link to GitHub has been moved.

In order for this blog to be a good resource for them, we plan to:\n\n-   share our own analytical approach and R code\n-   illustrate how and why we made certain analytical decisions and\n-   discuss what we learned along the way, both about the data and R.\n\nWe hope that this blog will inspire others to do the same, and to share their code too. Here, we won't try to interpret any regional differences in winter performance. We know that there are several factors involved, so we will leave this up to others with more local knowledge.\n\n# 1. R packages we used\n\nThe [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages is a useful set of tools for data analysis and visualisation that are designed to work together. It contains the [{ggplot}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, which we use for visualisations. \n\n(Need help getting started with R and the {tidyverse}? Try the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) website).\n\nWe use a function from the {readxl} package to import Excel files and the {lubridate} package, which makes working with dates a lot easier. Both are part of the {tidyverse}.\n\n\n\nNote: if you would like to run this code in your own R session and you haven't installed these packages already, you will need to do so (once) using the `install.packages()` function.\n\n# 2. Data download from NHS Digital\n\nAfter setting up the tools, we downloaded Winter Daily SitRep 2018–19 Data from the NHS Digital website. Rather than opting for the spreadsheets that contain one week of data each, we went for the more convenient time series file, which contains all data from this winter up to the latest release. One drawback is that the name of this file changes weekly as new data is added (so, should you try to use this code at a later date, you will probably have to adapt the file name).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Download file\nfilename <- \"Winter-data-timeseries-20190307.xlsx\"\nurl <- \"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/Winter-data-timeseries-20190307.xlsx\"\n\ndownload.file(url, destfile = filename, mode = \"wb\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nResponse [https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/Winter-data-timeseries-20190307.xlsx]\n  Date: 2025-06-23 12:47\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\n  Size: 1.51 MB\n<ON DISK>  C:\\Users\\THOMAS~1.JEM\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpe2ltDH\\file389ce42d6a.xlsx\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# 3. Data import from R-unfriendly spreadsheets\n\nHow we tackled multi-line headers with merged cells\n\nOnce we opened the file in Excel, we saw a number of sheets containing different indicators. With a few exceptions, most have a similar table structure. As we were interested in patient flow through hospitals, we focused on ‘**General and acute beds**' and **‘Beds occupied by long-stay patients**' for now.\n\nWhat the sheets with these indicators had in common was that there was **metadata** in the first 13 lines followed by a two-line **header**. Several columns containing variables (second header line) were grouped within dates (first header line) and the cells around the dates were merged. There were also some empty columns and rows, which we addressed later on.\n\n![Example of the Excel layout of Winter SitRep data to be imported into R. Source: NHS Digital.](img/excel_layout.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the Excel spreadsheet with metadata and blank lines\"}\n\nUnfortunately, this was not yet a [tidy table](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-tidy-data), as the dates that served as column headers were values, not variable names. All this made importing the file into R slightly more challenging. We fixed this by creating a custom `import_sitrep()` function that would:\n\n-   read and store the data and the two lines of the header separately,\n-   combine the two lines of the header,\n-   add the combined header to the data and tidy up column names by removing special characters,\n-   and finally convert the table into a tidy table ready for the next step.\n\nBut wait, there was one more **tricky bit**. What happened when we tried to read in the headers one by one?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_indicator <- \"G&A beds\"\n\n# First line contains dates in merged cells (5 cells merged each in this case)\nheader_1 <- read_xlsx(\n  path = filename,\n  sheet = example_indicator,\n  skip = 13,\n  col_names = FALSE,\n  n_max = 1\n)\n\n# Second line contains variable names\nheader_2 <- read_xlsx(\n  path = filename,\n  sheet = example_indicator,\n  skip = 14,\n  col_names = FALSE,\n  n_max = 1\n)\n\ndim(header_1)\n# [1]   1 451\ndim(header_2)\n# [1]   1 459\n# why is header_1 eight columns shorter than header_2?\n\n# Start of header 1\nheader_1[1:10]\n# #  A tibble: 1 x 10\n#    X__1                X__2  X__3  X__4  X__5  X__6                X__7  X__8  X__9  X__10\n#    <dttm>              <lgl> <lgl> <lgl> <lgl> <dttm>              <lgl> <lgl> <lgl> <lgl>\n# 1 2018-12-03 00:00:00 NA    NA    NA    NA    2018-12-04 00:00:00 NA    NA    NA    NA\n\n# starts with the date column, we lost the few columns that contain trust code, name and so on. in line 2\n\n# End of header 1\nheader_1[(ncol(header_1) - 10):ncol(header_1)]\n# # A tibble: 1 x 11\n#   X__441              X__442 X__443 X__444 X__445 X__446              X__447 X__448 X__449 X__450 X__451\n#   <dttm>              <lgl>  <lgl>  <lgl>  <lgl>  <dttm>              <lgl>  <lgl>  <lgl>  <lgl>  <dttm>\n# 1 2019-03-01 00:00:00 NA     NA     NA     NA     2019-03-02 00:00:00 NA     NA     NA     NA     2019-03-03 00:00:00\n\n# ends with only one column for 3 March - we lost the last four columns containing NA\n```\n:::\n\n\n*Sigh*… they ended up not having the same length. The first header line (containing the dates) was 8 elements shorter. Looking at its left and right side (see above) gave us a hint as to why this might have happened:\n\n-   In the Excel sheet, the first few cells in this line were empty and when the line was read in, they were converted to NA. The `read_xlsx()` function then discarded these empty columns (probably) because they were at the beginning.\n-   There were also some merged cells. During import they were separated and, if empty, converted to NA. Empty columns at the end of the header line also seem to be discarded by `read_xlsx()`.\n\nSo, we needed to find a way to preserve the length of the first header line in our `import_sitrep()` function. This is how we solved it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimport_sitrep <- function(file, indicator) {\n  data <- read_xlsx(path = file, sheet = indicator, skip = 15, col_names = FALSE)\n\n  # Extract first header line containing dates and fill the gaps:\n  # Read 2 lines but guess the data types only from the first row\n  # Based on the first line, the function expects dates and\n  # convert the second row to NA\n  # As a result, the right length is preserved.\n  header_1 <- read_xlsx(path = file, sheet = indicator, skip = 13, col_names = FALSE, n_max = 2, guess_max = 1)\n\n  # Convert to columns, fill in the gaps and convert into vector\n  header_1 <- header_1 %>%\n    t() %>%\n    as.data.frame() %>%\n    fill(., \"V1\")\n  header_1 <- as.character(header_1$V1)\n\n  # Extract second header and convert into vector\n  header_2 <- read_xlsx(path = file, sheet = indicator, skip = 14, col_names = FALSE, n_max = 1)\n  header_2 <- unname(unlist(header_2[1, ]))\n\n  # Concatenating headers to create column names\n  # Replace NAs with a placeholder, otherwise concatenation fails\n  column_names <- str_c(str_replace_na(header_1, \"placeholder\"), str_replace_na(header_2, \"placeholder\"), sep = \"_\")\n\n  # Add column names to data and tidy\n  names(data) <- tolower(column_names)\n  names(data) <- gsub(\" \", \".\", names(data))\n  names(data) <- gsub(\"placeholder_\", \"\", names(data))\n  names(data) <- gsub(\"'\", \"\", names(data))\n  names(data) <- gsub(\"<\", \"less.than\", names(data))\n  names(data) <- gsub(\">\", \"more.than\", names(data))\n\n  # Tidy up table\n  data_tidy <- data %>%\n    # remove empty column and line\n    select(-placeholder) %>%\n    filter(!is.na(name)) %>%\n    # Separate variables and dates\n    gather(-1, -2, -3, key = \"date_type\", value = \"value\") %>%\n    separate(date_type, into = c(\"date\", \"type\"), sep = \"_\") %>%\n    spread(key = \"type\", value = \"value\") %>%\n    # convert to the right variable types\n    mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%\n    mutate_at(vars(5:ncol(.)), funs(as.numeric))\n\n  data_tidy\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we had our import function, we were ready to read and combine the sheets containing the winter indicators ‘**General and acute beds**' and ‘**Beds occupied by long-stay patients**'.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsheets_to_import <- c(\"G&A beds\", \"Beds Occ by long stay patients\")\n\nSitrep_daily <- sheets_to_import %>%\n  map(import_sitrep,\n    file = filename\n  ) %>%\n  reduce(left_join,\n    by = c(\"nhs.england.region\", \"code\", \"name\", \"date\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What does our data look like now?\ndim(Sitrep_daily)\n# [1] 12285    12\n\nhead(Sitrep_daily)\n# # A tibble: 6 x 12\n#   nhs.england.reg~ code  name  date       core.beds.open escalation.beds~ occupancy.rate total.beds.occd total.beds.open\n#   <chr>            <chr> <chr> <date>              <dbl>            <dbl>          <dbl>           <dbl>           <dbl>\n# 1 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-03          93702             2701          0.949           91533           96403\n# 2 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-04          93720             2556          0.949           91322           96276\n# 3 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-05          93739             2434          0.948           91143           96173\n# 4 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-06          93617             2389          0.946           90862           96006\n# 5 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-07          93822             2084          0.931           89333           95906\n# 6 -                -     ENGL~ 2018-12-08          93635             2191          0.929           89021           95826\n# # ... with 3 more variables: more.than.14.days <dbl>, more.than.21.days <dbl>, more.than.7.days <dbl>\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data was now tidy, as each variable formed a column and each observation formed a row. Note that the observations for England in the table were followed by values for individual hospital trusts.\n\n# 4. Data cleaning\n\n## Trust exclusions\n\nWe excluded the three **children's hospitals** when calculating aggregate measures, such as the average bed occupancy within STPs. Our reasoning was that their patient profiles would be different from other acute trusts and this might skew the averages. Nevertheless, we kept track of them at a trust level.\n\nThis applies to Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust (code **RQ3**), Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust (**RBS**) and Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust (**RCU**).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrusts_to_exclude_for_aggregation <- c(\"RQ3\", \"RBS\", \"RCU\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How we approached defining ‘missingness': when is a zero not a zero?\n\nData collection and validation errors do happen, so finding suspicious data points is an important step during data cleaning.\n\nWhile this is easy if a value is missing (or NA), it's much harder to decide whether a zero truly represents ‘zero events' or a missing value (in fact, it could even be both within the same data set). To distinguish between the two, at the Health Foundation we came up with the following criteria:\n\n- How likely is a ‘zero event' for an indicator? For example, when counting beds in a large hospital the likelihood of having zero open seems small, but when counting long-stay patients having none seems possible.\n- How consistent is the zero value, in that trust, over time? Or in plain English: does the value jump from a higher number to zero (and back) or is it hovering somewhere close to zero.\n\nThe next two sections describe how we found and dealt with these missing values.\n\n## Finding longer periods of missing data\n\nIf any hospital trust had missing values, in any indicator, on **4 or more consecutive days** during the reporting period, it was excluded from the analysis. We were only looking for these periods in variables where we would not expect any zeros (the list is shown as cols_to_check).\n\nWhy this particular cut-off?

This left us with 128 out of 134 trusts.\n\nIt's worth noting that with this data-driven approach different trusts might be excluded each year and the number of excluded trusts could change over the winter period as new ‘gaps' appear.

Feature engineering\n\n**Adding organisational information on sustainability and transformation partnerships (STPs)**\n\nAs we wanted to compare indicators between local areas, we decided to calculate averages of winter indicators over hospital trusts within each STP. To do this, we needed to add variables to the raw data that indicated which hospital trust belonged to which STP. Unfortunately, we were not aware that this information was available in a format convenient for data analysis.\n\nSo, we manually created and validated a lookup table to map hospital trusts to STPs, using information related to the 2017/18 formation of 44 STPs from NHS England. While some STPs have since changed (for example, three STPs in the north of England merged in August 2018), this was the latest and most comprehensive information available, as far as we are aware.\n\n::: aside\nPages no longer found: <https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/stps/view-stps/>\n<https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/organisation-data-service-news-and-latest-updates/august-2018-newsletter>\n:::\n\nThe allocation of most hospital trusts to STPs was straightforward using this list, but there were a few instances where we had to choose:\n\n- If a trust did not appear in any STP list, it was matched according to the location of its main acute site. This was the case for four trusts in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and North Durham STP.\n- If a trust was mentioned in more than one STP plan, it was allocated according to the location of its main acute site. This applied to both Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Epsom And St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust.\n\nWe think this is a reasonable approach when analysing winter indicators, which mainly come from acute trusts, but we would be keen to hear your feedback.\n\nOnce we had this lookup table, we imported it into R and merged it with the winter indicators:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSTP_lookup <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HFAnalyticsLab/Winter_pressures/85313135c7dee393f52fa47596f04eb390bc43a3/Trust-STP-lookup.csv\")\n\n# join by code only to avoid any problems due to inconsistencies in spelling\nSitrep_daily <- Sitrep_daily %>%\n  left_join(STP_lookup[c(\"code\", \"STP\", \"STP_code\")], by = c(\"code\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe lookup table is also available on Github. Please note that STPs change and develop over time, so if you would like to use it, it's worth checking that the information is up to date.\n\n## Making read-outs comparable between trusts: from raw counts to rates\n\nAs hospital trusts come in different sizes and serve different numbers of patients, raw patient counts are not suitable for comparisons between trusts or regions. Percentages or fractions, such bed occupancy rates, are more comparable.\n\nTherefore, we derived the fraction of occupied beds, which are occupied by long-stay patients over 7, 14 or 21 days:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# rate of occupied beds that are occupied by long-stay patients\nSitrep_daily <- Sitrep_daily %>%\n  mutate(\n    more.than.7.rate = more.than.7.days / total.beds.occd,\n    more.than.14.rate = more.than.14.days / total.beds.occd,\n    more.than.21.rate = more.than.21.days / total.beds.occd\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 6.  Aggregation: monthly averages by STP\n\nIn some cases, it might be useful to visualise daily changes, but weekly or even monthly aggregates have the advantage of being less noisy, free of weekday-weekend variation and can potentially be more useful to monitor longer-term trends.\n\nFirst, we created a new column that contained the corresponding month. The month was then used as grouping variable, along with the trust or STP code, to calculate monthly averages of bed occupancy and long-stay patient rates.\n\nFor weekly averages, an alternative would have been to create a new column containing the date of the respective beginning of the week using the `cut()` function (also shown below).\n\nWe know it's also good practice to keep track of the number of valid observations (as in, not NA) that we average over within each group used. In this instance, for trust-level aggregates, this represented the number of days within a week. For STP-level aggregates, it corresponded to the number of trusts within the STP.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSitrep_daily <- Sitrep_daily %>%\n  mutate(\n    week_start = as.Date(cut(date, breaks = \"week\", start.on.monday = TRUE)), # can be used to aggregate by week\n    month = format(date, format = \"%B\")\n  )\n\n# Monthly average on trust level\nSitrep_monthly_average_bytrust <- Sitrep_daily %>%\n  group_by(nhs.england.region, code, name, STP, STP_code, month) %>%\n  # Count the number of valid observations for each variable\n  # BEFORE we overwrite the variables\n  summarize(\n    occupancy.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(occupancy.rate)),\n    more.than.7.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.7.rate)),\n    more.than.14.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.14.rate)),\n    more.than.21.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.21.rate)),\n    occupancy.rate = mean(occupancy.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.7.rate = mean(more.than.7.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.14.rate = mean(more.than.14.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.21.rate = mean(more.than.21.rate, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n# Monthly average on STP level\nSitrep_monthly_average_bySTP <- Sitrep_monthly_average_bytrust %>%\n  filter(!is.element(code, trusts_to_exclude_for_aggregation)) %>%\n  group_by(STP, STP_code, month) %>%\n  summarise(\n    occupancy.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(occupancy.rate)),\n    more.than.7.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.7.rate)),\n    more.than.14.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.14.rate)),\n    more.than.21.rate.valid = sum(!is.na(more.than.21.rate)),\n    occupancy.rate = mean(occupancy.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.7.rate = mean(more.than.7.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.14.rate = mean(more.than.14.rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    more.than.21.rate = mean(more.than.21.rate, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nAt this point, we also saved the tidy and aggregated data as a CSV file for visualisation in other programs, such as Tableau.\n\n# 7.

We were then ready to plot and save the map:\n\n\n::: {.cell .preview-image}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSTP_shape_monthly <- my_sf |>\n  left_join(Sitrep_monthly_average_bySTP, by = c(\"stp17cd\" = \"STP_code\"))\n\nSTP_shape_monthly <- STP_shape_monthly %>%\n  # Divide variable into intervals and turn into factors\n  mutate(\n    occupancy.rate.cut = cut(occupancy.rate,\n      breaks = c(0, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1),\n      labels = c(\"85% or less\", \"85-90%\", \"90-95%\", \"over 95%\")\n    ),\n    occupancy.rate.cut = factor(as.character(occupancy.rate.cut),\n      levels = rev(levels(occupancy.rate.cut))\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  # Remove lines relating England as a whole\n  filter(!is.na(STP)) %>%\n  # Turn STPs and months into factors (ignoring March)\n  mutate(\n    id = factor(stp17cd,\n      levels = unique(stp17cd)\n    ),\n    month = factor(month,\n      levels = c(\"December\", \"January\", \"February\")\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(month))\n\n# Plot and save the map\nggplot(STP_shape_monthly, aes(\n  x = long,\n  y = lat,\n  fill = occupancy.rate.cut\n)) +\n  geom_sf(colour = \"white\") +\n  # Remove grid lines\n  theme_void() +\n  # Ensure correct aspect ratio\n  coord_sf() +\n  # Facet by month\n  facet_grid(. ~ month, switch = \"x\") +\n  # Define colour palette\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#dd0031\", \"#ee7074\", \"#f2a0a2\", \"#aad3e5\"), drop = FALSE) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE, label.hjust = 0)) +\n  labs(title = \"Average bed occupancy within STPs during winter 2018/19\") +\n  # Other design choices\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, colour = \"#005078\", margin = margin(b = 15, unit = \"mm\")),\n    legend.justification = c(1, 0),\n    legend.key = element_blank(),\n    legend.margin = margin(t = 5, b = 5, l = 10, r = 10, unit = \"mm\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(colour = \"#524c48\"),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.spacing.x = unit(10, \"mm\"),\n    legend.spacing.y = unit(10, \"mm\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(colour = \"#524c48\", margin = margin(b = 10))\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](using-r-to-track-nhs-winter-pressures_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow could we have improved this map further? One option might have been to interactively display STP averages when hovering over the map using the [{plotly}](https://r-graph-gallery.com/interactive-charts) package, for example.\n\n# 8.  What have we learned?\n\nLots! No, seriously… Using this workflow, rather than copy and paste, has saved us a lot of time this winter. But beyond that, creating (then revisiting and improving) this workflow turned out to be a great way to work together and to make our analysis more transparent, more reproducible and easier to understand.\n\nKey points we are taking away:\n\n- With trusts, CCGs, STPs, ICSs, and more to choose from when we're looking at local variation within health care systems, **it can be challenging to pick the right organisational level**. Local health care structures are also changing and evolving rapidly. We need to do more thinking about which level is most informative and compare different option, suggestions are welcome.\n- **Some cleaning is a must**. Winter data has a quick turnaround and NHS Digital only perform minimal validation. However, compared to previous years, the 2018/19 winter data quality has markedly improved (you can use our code to check the improvement for yourself).\n- But **cleaning decisions impact interpretability**. If the list of excluded trusts changes between years (based on how well they are reporting in any given year), this makes the data less comparable year-on-year.\n- **We'll play it safe with derived variables**. The effort of rederiving them ourselves was worth it for the peace of mind we got from knowing that they were calculated consistently and meant exactly what we thought they meant.\n- Next winter, **our future selves will be very happy** to have our analysis nicely documented with code that is ready to go. It should even be easy to adapt the same workflow for other open NHS data sets (we'll save this for another time).\n\n**Editor note:**\n- Updating this blog from 2019 in 2024 required a number of changes to functions and packages but the code was easier to change and debug than to build from scratch, particularly for someone who isn't familiar with any mapping or geospatial coding! \n\n{tidyverse} was used in recoding where the original was sometimes in base R.\n\nThis blog has been formatted to remove [Latin Abbreviations](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#avoid-latin-abbreviation) and edited for [NHS-R Style](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#referencing-r-packages-and-functions-in-text) and to ensure running of code in Quarto and to update deprecated functions.\n",
