Moveable public holidays, when register offices are closed, affect the number of registrations made in the published weeks and in the corresponding weeks in previous years.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 Counts of deaths by underlying cause exclude deaths at age under 28 days.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3 Coding of deaths by underlying cause for the latest week is not yet complete.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n4 Does not include deaths where age is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts of 'Persons', 'Males' and 'Females' may not sum to 'Total Deaths, all ages'.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5 Does not include deaths of those resident outside England and Wales or those records where the place of residence is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts for \"Deaths by Region of usual residence\" may not sum to \"Total deaths, all ages\".\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n### Later confirmation of deaths\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAggregate numbers of deaths are later confirmed and released in by [ONS monthly](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/monthlyfiguresondeathsregisteredbyareaofusualresidence). Numbers are released at a lower geographical level to the weekly data. \n\n## Preparation of data\n\nIn order to prepare this data for analysis the worksheet for weekly figures was extracted and the data was moved to long form and merged together over the available years. This was extracted in April 2020 when full previous years' data was available.\n\nThe dataset contains:\n\n- __category_1:__ character, containing the names of the groups for counts, e.g. \"Total deaths\", \"all ages\".\n- __category_2:__ character, subcategory of names of groups where necessary, e.g. details of region: \"East\", details of age bands \"15-44\".\n- __counts:__ numeric, numbers of deaths in whole numbers and average numbers with decimal points. To retain the integrity of the format this column data is left as character.\n- __date:__ date, format is yyyy-mm-dd; all dates are a Friday.\n- __week_no:__ integer, each week in a year is numbered sequentially.\n\n# Source and licence acknowledgement\n\nThis data has been made available through Office of National Statistics under the [Open Government\nLicence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).\n\nThe main page for downloads is found on the [ONS People Population and Community pages](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales).\n\n## Creating the dataset\n\nSpreadsheets are in xls format from 2010 to 2019.\n\nEach week is released with a new file name listing the week number and all weeks for that year are included in the spreadsheet. Counts for weeks ahead are missing and listed as NA. \n\nWhen a year has passed it is renamed to the year name and does not change.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 2019\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2019/publishedweek522019.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2019Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2018\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2018/publishedweek522018withupdatedrespiratoryrow.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2018Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2017\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2017/publishedweek522017.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2017Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2016\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2016/publishedweek522016.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2016Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2015\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2015/publishedweek2015.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2015Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2014\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2014/publishedweek2014.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2014Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2013\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2013/publishedweek2013.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2013Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2012\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2012/publishedweek2012.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2012Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2011\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2011/publishedweek2011.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2011Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n\n# 2010\ndownload.file(\n  \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2010/publishedweek2010.xls\",\n  destfile = \"2010Mortality.xls\",\n  method = \"wininet\",\n  mode = \"wb\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Extracting worksheets to csv\n\nThe data can be found in the worksheet called Weekly figures \"date/year\".

Week 1 2011 has been coded to both versions to give an indication of the impact of the change.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n### 2014\n\n* For deaths registered from January 2014, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using IRIS software. Further information about the implementation of the software is available on the ONS website. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n* All deaths registered in week 2 were dual-coded using both ICD-10 v2010 (NCHS) and ICD-10 v2013 (IRIS). An information note providing the preliminary findings on the impact of the implementation of IRIS software for ICD-10 cause of death coding on mortality statistics in England and Wales is available on the ONS website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n### 2015\n\n* For deaths registered from January 2014, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using IRIS software. Further information about the [implementation of the software](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106020045/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/health-and-life-events/Changes-to-cause-of-death-coding-in-England-and-Wales/index.html) is available on the ONS website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n## Age bands\n\nNumbers are provided for categories: Persons, Females and Males. \n\nAs detailed in the notes, if the age is missing or not coded at the time of release then the counts of 'Persons', 'Males' and 'Females' may not sum to 'Total Deaths, all ages'.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNote that these age bands were changed in 2020 releases.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nons_mortality %>% \n  select(category_1, category_2) %>% \n  group_by(category_1, category_2) %>% \n  filter(category_1 %in% c('Persons','Females','Males')) %>% \n  slice(1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Remove working_files folder\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunlink(\"working_files\", recursive = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Citations\n\nThe data used to build the mortality dataset in this package is released under © Crown copyright and is free to use under the terms of the Open Government Licence. \nAny subsequent use should include a source accreditation to ONS - Source: Office for National Statistics licensed under the Open Government Licence.\n",
