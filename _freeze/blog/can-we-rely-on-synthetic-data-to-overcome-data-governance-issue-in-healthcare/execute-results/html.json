I start wondering what does it mean? I found that it is different from the dummy data, but in what ways and how is it different, I began to wonder?\n\nI become curious to find out more about it, as nowadays it is difficult to get hold of healthcare data (that is., NHS). The most prominent issues seem to link to data governance and access, as this information is personal sensitive data.\n\nI investigated methods for creating ‘synthetic data' as a tool that might help to develop better prediction models, as data could be available for a much larger pool of people, who can tackle these data governance and other challenging healthcare issues.\n\n### **What is Synthetic data?**\n\nThe goal is to generate a data set which contains no real units, therefore safe for public release and retains the structure of the data.\n\nIn other words, one can say that synthetic data contains all the characteristics of original data minus the sensitive content.\n\nSynthetic data is generally made to validate mathematical models. This data is used to compare the behaviour of the real data against the one generated by the model.\n\n### **How we generate synthetic data?**\n\nThe principle is to observe real-world statistic distributions from the original data and reproduce fake data by drawing simple numbers.\n\nConsider a data set with *p* variables. In a nutshell, synthesis follows these steps:\n\n1.  Take a simple random sample of *x~1,obs~* and set as *x~1,syn~*\n\n2.  Fit model *f(x~2,obs~\\|x~1,obs~)* and draw *x~2,syn~* from *f(x~2,syn~\\|x~1,syn~)*\n\n3.  Fit model *f(x~3,obs~\\|x~1,obs~* , *x~2,obs~* ) and draw *x~3,syn~*  from *f(x~3,syn~\\|x~1,syn~* , *x~2,syn~* )\n\n4.  And so on, until *f(x~p,syn~\\|x~1,syn~* , *x~2,syn~* , … , *x~p-1,syn~*)\n\nFitting statistical models to the original data and generating completely new records for public release.\\\nJoint distribution *f(x~1~, x~2~, x~3~, …, x~p~)* is approximated by a set of conditional distributions *f(x~2~\\|x~1~)*.\n\nFor instance, we have the following original (real) data.\n\n\n:::

Moreover, synthetic data is constantly improving, and methods like validation and calibration will continue to make these data sources more realistic.\n\nBesides synthetic data used to protect the privacy and confidentiality of set of data, it can be used for testing fraud detection systems by creating realistic behaviour profiles for users and attackers. In machine learning, it can also be used to train and test models. The synthetic data can aid in creating a baseline for future testing or studies such as clinical trial studies.\n\n*Dr Muhammad Faisal and Gary Hutson*\n",
