You could manually edit the output from dput() or df_paste.\n\n### An alternative way to modify your data for sharing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a dataframe of organisation names and aliases\nOrganisation <- unique(NHSRdatasets::LOS_model$Organisation)\nlength(Organisation) # checks the length of the vector Organisation\nalias <- letters[1:10] # if you want to automate this you could use letters[1:length(Organisation)]\ndf <- data.frame(Organisation, alias) # combines the 2 vectors into a dataframe\n```\n:::\n\n\nJoin the dataframe we just created to the LOS_model dataframe, select the columns we want & take a sample 10 rows, before piping it into dput() to create the code we can share.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndplyr::left_join(NHSRdatasets::LOS_model, df) |>\n  select(Age, alias, Death) |>\n  slice_sample(n = 10) |>\n  dput()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## What should you include?\n\n-   libraries used\n\n-   your code and an explanation of what you're trying to achieve\n\n-   the smallest dataset that still works\n\n-   error messages\n\n-   what solutions you've already tried\n\n-   check that the code you're sharing works exactly like your original code with the issue. Sometimes you'll realise for yourself what the solution is at this point!\n\n-   check that the code you're sharing works exactly like your original code with the issue.\n\n\nDon't include:\n\n-   anything confidential\n\n-   any code that isn't essential to the part you're asking about\n\n## Where can you ask for help?\n\n[NHS-R Community Slack forum](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/ \"A friendly and inclusive community of NHS colleagues who will always try to help\")\n\n[The Posit forum, hosted by the company that makes and maintains RStudio](https://forum.posit.co/)\n",
