During the event, a QR code, posted around the venue and online, allowed attendees to give feedback on all aspects of the conference experience. This report summarises that feeback.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout}\n📢 **Headline** 📢\n\nThe 2025 RPySOC conference was a **highly successful** event. \n\nThe open analytics community found it well orgainsed and extremely valuable for upskilling attendees, fostering an enthusiastic and supportive community, disseminating best practice and novel approaches. This conference constitutes a key element of how the recommendations from the Goldacre report[^1] should be implemented, for the benefit of patients and the public.\n\n[^1]:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis \n\n:::\n\n## Attendance and Respondents\n\nIn total, there were 125 in person attendees and 353 people joined online.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/attendance-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn total 43 attendees completed the feedback form, representing a large range of employer types from all over the UK and further afield.\nFeedback was submitted mostly by in-person attendees.\n\nThere were 29 responders that attended both days in person.\nOf virtual attendees, 10 attended both days virtually.\n1 person attended a mixture of in-person and virtual events.\n\nOf those responders who attended at least one day in person, 16/33 were funded by their employer to attend. 11/33 attendees self-funded their attendance.\n\n## Communications\n\nRespondents heard about the conferenece through a mix of channels, the most numerous being Slack, NHS-R community website and word of mouth.\n\n#### _All respondents rated pre-conference communications as good, very good or excellent._\n\n## Accessibility\n\nRespondents rated the registration process as good to excellent, and the number of breaks and the check-in process as good to excellent in almost all cases. \n\nTo maximise accessibility of speaker questions in the hybrid event, all questions for speakers and their responses were housed on Slack.  Respondents were asked about the ease of submitting questions on Slack, how suitable that medium was. \n\nThe use of Slack for speaker questions recieved a mixed response.  \nTwelve respondents rated its use as not effective or only somewhat effective, compared to 29 respondents reporting Slack use as very or extremely effective. \nOne comment was submitted to explain the \"Not at all effective\" response to Slack use. \nThis comment described the respondent's frustration with using Slack through the browser, since their organisation does not allow its installation on managed devices.  \n\n86% of respondents rated the ease of submitting questions on Slack as good, very good or excellent.\n\n## In-Person experience\n\nElements of the in-person conference experience that were rated positively (fair to excellent) included the check-in process efficiency, seating, toilets access, refreshments and visual display quality. \nOne person rated the availability of suitable signage as poor, one rated the location as poor, two rated the availability of power outlets for charging devices as poor, and two respondents rated the menu options as poor, whereas all other respondents rated these elements positively (largest group rating each as `Excellent`).\n\n#### _The unconference session was rated as extremely valuable by most respondents (18/34), and only one respondent rated it 'Not so valuable'. 31/43 respondents would consider attenging the unconference again in future._\n\n## Virtual experience\n\n#### _The ease of joining the live stream was rated as good to excellent by all respondents._\nThe video quality experienced some initial technical issues on day 1, which were soon rectified. \nThis was reflected in the ratings and comments for this aspect of the conference.

These included mention of:\n\n- Adding in a 'Work in Progress' section\n- simplify the sign-up process\n- more formal speaker introductions by chairs\n- 'speed dating' for networking\n- consider reducing the number of talks on day 1 to encourage more networking\n\n#### _All 43 respondents said they were likely or very likely to recommend the RPySOC conference to others and would be attending next year (37 in person, and 6 virtually)._\nElements of the conference that respondents said they liked most included:\n\n- learning practical new skills\n- the community of inclusive, open, friendly, like-minded people\n- organisation\n- time keeping, the pace of the event\n- consistent narrative\n- open code, shared slides\n- brilliant key note speakers\n- Unconference\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n_\"It’s just full of great people doing interesting work \"_\n\n_\"Meeting people in the same boat undergoing the same challenges, i felt so inspired afterwards \"_\n\n_\"The conference content and unconference were top notch as usual.
