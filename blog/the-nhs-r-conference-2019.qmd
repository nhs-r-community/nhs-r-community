  "Our second ever NHS-R Conference in Birmingham"
---

We really enjoyed our second ever NHS-R conference in Birmingham, which was attended by about 300 delegates. We tried to ensure that there was something for colleagues who are new to R as well as for those who are more experienced. The conference was inspiring, exciting, friendly and tiring and we obtained some fantastic feedback from attendees about how much they enjoyed the conference.

> Let me take this opportunity to thank you for organising a brilliant conference. I learnt more in two days than I had in weeks on my own. Your enthusiasm is extremely catchy and inspirational. Although I am relatively new in R, I am hooked on to it and wonder why I didn't learn it before. I have already converted one person to R, my husband a consultant Psychiatrist in Edinburgh üôÇ ‚Ä¶Once again thank you for your wonderful interactions during two days.

> think that the organisation was excellent, and the quality of the workshops and talks offered was extremely high‚Ä¶. I thoroughly enjoyed catching up with people that I already knew as well as meeting new friends. I have also come away with new skills to hone and new techniques to adopt and share in my work.

> I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the event and (it was) probably the best conference I've attended.

Matthew Francis ‚Äì Principal Public Health Intelligence Analyst and advanced R user

> I don't think I've got the words to describe how fantastic the event was, fantastic just isn't enough. I even presented at this conference after only learning R in the last couple of years. Truly, this was only possible because of the NHS-R community.

We had some technical glitches on the day and some of the rooms were not ideal, so we want to thank our delegates for being so forgiving, patient and enthusiastic. Likewise, we want to thank our conference organisers, our helpers, our speakers, our funders ‚Äì The Health Foundation ‚Äì our sponsors (Mango Solution, Jumping Rivers, Healthcare Evaluation Data from University Hospitals Birmingham), our partners (AphA, The Strategy Unit, Improvement Academy, University of Bradford, HDRUK) and all the staff at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground for helping make our conference a huge success.

We have already started thinking about next year's conference, and if you have any suggestions on how to make the next one better please let us know via email [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net).

We also made some important announcements about NHS-R Community 2.0. This will be covered in a subsequent blog, but for now there is an announcement of free tickets to the EARL (Enterprise Applications of the R Language) conference 2020 which has been described as ‚ÄúThe highlight of the R calendar in Europe‚Äù by  Andre Andrie de Vries of RStudio.
