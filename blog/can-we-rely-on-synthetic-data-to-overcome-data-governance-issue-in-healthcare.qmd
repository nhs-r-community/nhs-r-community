I recently came across a term **synthetic data**. I start wondering what does it mean? I found that it is different from the dummy data, but in what ways and how is it different, I began to wonder?

I become curious to find out more about it, as nowadays it is difficult to get hold of healthcare data (that is., NHS). The most prominent issues seem to link to data governance and access, as this information is personal sensitive data.

I investigated methods for creating ‘synthetic data’ as a tool that might help to develop better prediction models, as data could be available for a much larger pool of people, who can tackle these data governance and other challenging healthcare issues.

### **What is Synthetic data?**

The goal is to generate a data set which contains no real units, therefore safe for public release and retains the structure of the data.

In other words, one can say that synthetic data contains all the characteristics of original data minus the sensitive content.

Synthetic data is generally made to validate mathematical models. This data is used to compare the behaviour of the real data against the one generated by the model.

### **How we generate synthetic data?**

The principle is to observe real-world statistic distributions from the original data and reproduce fake data by drawing simple numbers.

Consider a data set with *p* variables. In a nutshell, synthesis follows these steps:

1.  Take a simple random sample of *x~1,obs~* and set as *x~1,syn~*

2.  Fit model *f(x~2,obs~\|x~1,obs~)* and draw *x~2,syn~* from *f(x~2,syn~\|x~1,syn~)*

3.  Fit model *f(x~3,obs~\|x~1,obs~* , *x~2,obs~* ) and draw *x~3,syn~*  from *f(x~3,syn~\|x~1,syn~* , *x~2,syn~* )

4.  And so on, until *f(x~p,syn~\|x~1,syn~* , *x~2,syn~* , … , *x~p-1,syn~*)

Fitting statistical models to the original data and generating completely new records for public release.\
Joint distribution *f(x~1~, x~2~, x~3~, …, x~p~)* is approximated by a set of conditional distributions *f(x~2~\|x~1~)*.

For instance, we have the following original (real) data.

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
      ~sex,                   ~edu, ~age, ~depress,
  "FEMALE",   "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  57L,       6L,
    "MALE",   "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  20L,       0L,
  "FEMALE",   "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  18L,       0L,
  "FEMALE", "PRIMARY/NO EDUCATION",  78L,      16L,
  "FEMALE",   "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  54L,       4L,
    "MALE",            "SECONDARY",  20L,       5L,
  "FEMALE",            "SECONDARY",  39L,       2L,
    "MALE",            "SECONDARY",  39L,       4L,
  "FEMALE",            "SECONDARY",  43L,       0L,
  "FEMALE",            "SECONDARY",  63L,       6L
  )

```

We can generate synthetic data using the algorithm described above.

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
      ~sex,                       ~edu, ~age, ~depress,
    "MALE",     "PRIMARY/NO EDUCATION",  81L,      11L,
  "FEMALE",                "SECONDARY",  75L,       9L,
  "FEMALE",       "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  43L,       6L,
  "FEMALE",       "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  65L,       3L,
    "MALE", "POST-SECONDARY OR HIGHER",  17L,       3L,
    "MALE",                "SECONDARY",  39L,       3L,
    "MALE",                "SECONDARY",  35L,       1L,
  "FEMALE",       "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  35L,       2L,
    "MALE", "POST-SECONDARY OR HIGHER",  38L,       0L,
    "MALE",       "VOCATIONAL/GRAMMAR",  25L,       0L
  )

```

We can compare the distribution of original data with synthetic data as follows:

### **National early warning score (NEWS) example in R:**

```{r}
library(NHSRdatasets)
library(dplyr)

df <- NHSRdatasets::synthetic_news_data

df |> 
  slice_head(n = 10)

```

```{r}
summary(df)
```

### Generate the synthetic NEWS data using synthpop R package

```{r}
library(synthpop)

syn_df <- syn(df, seed = 4321)

# synthetic data
syn_df$syn[1:10,]
```

```{r}
summary(syn_df$syn) 

```

```{r}
#| eval: false

write.csv("synthetic_news_data.csv")

## "","x"
## "1","synthetic_news_data.csv"
```

### **Summary**

In many ways, synthetic data reflects George Box’s observation that “all models are wrong, but some are useful” while providing a “useful approximation \[of\] those found in the real world,”

The connection between the clinical outcomes of a patient visits and costs rarely exist in practice, so being able to assess these trade-offs in synthetic data allow for measurement and enhancement of the value of care – cost divided by outcomes.

Synthetic data is likely not a 100% accurate depiction of real-world outcomes, like cost and clinical quality, but rather a useful approximation of these variables. Moreover, synthetic data is constantly improving, and methods like validation and calibration will continue to make these data sources more realistic.

Besides synthetic data used to protect the privacy and confidentiality of set of data, it can be used for testing fraud detection systems by creating realistic behaviour profiles for users and attackers. In machine learning, it can also be used to train and test models. The synthetic data can aid in creating a baseline for future testing or studies such as clinical trial studies.
