Recent projects include [OpenPrescribing.net](https://openprescribing.net/) and [OpenSAFELY.org](https://www.opensafely.org/), an open source secure data platform that has delivered high impact research analyses across 58 million patients‚Äô GP records, developed in close collaboration with electronic health record system suppliers TPP and Optum (formerly EMIS).

![**Sammi Rosser** is a researcher and teacher with an interest in how data science and operational research approaches can be used to improve the lives of patients. As a trainer on the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) program, she is passionate about spreading the word about open approaches and empowering people to learn Python and apply it to healthcare problems. Her work focuses on pathway simulation modelling, geographic optimization, and data visualisation, and she has developed a range of tools, packages and eBooks designed to make reproducible healthcare analytics more accessible. Drawing on her experience from her time in the NHS and from advising on NHS data science projects across the country, she emphasises practical and pragmatic approaches for advancing the way the NHS uses data to support better decision-making.](img/sammi_rosser.jpg){width="300"}

![**Dr Dan Chalk** is a Senior Research Fellow at the NIHR Applied Research Collaboration for the South West Peninsula (PenARC), Director of the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme since its inception, and former chair of the PenCHORD research team.¬† He has nearly 15 years of experience collaborating with the NHS to apply Operational Research and Data Science methods to improve service delivery, with particular expertise in Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Simulation, and his work has led to reductions in cancer waiting times, supported end of life care resource planning, and fed into national policy making on diabetic retinopathy screening.¬† He has spent the last 12 years teaching and mentoring NHS staff to develop and apply skills in modelling and data science, and is a firm believer that anyone can be taught how to code and how to develop models with the right support.¬† He is a passionate advocate of open science and the use of Free and Open Source solutions.](img/dan_chalk.png){width="300"}

![**Cara Thompson** is an Edinburgh-based data visualisation consultant. She specialises in helping teams of data folks make the most of dataviz to communicate their insights to non specialist audiences. Alongside training and commisions, a lot of her work revolves around creating and automating dataviz design systems - a set of rules for colours and fonts which allow analysts to create on-brand and accessible visualisations that also look good, without all the soul searching normally involved in doing that. She is passionate about equipping others to make the most of dataviz, and always looks forward to hearing what others are up to! ](img/cara_thompson.jpg){width="300"}
