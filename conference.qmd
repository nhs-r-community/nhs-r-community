The conference took place on Thursday 13th and Friday 14th November 2025 in the Wellcome Trust, London. We welcomed around 120 people in person, and up to 300 attendees joined our live stream.  It was a fantastic event, with a huge collection of fascinating and practical talks delivered in person and online, a vibrant and stimulating Unconference session, and a lot of delicious food!

Thank you again to everyone who attended, helped organise, presented, gave feedback, or were involved in any other way!
