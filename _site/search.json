    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike most of the 2017/2018 cohort, when I applied to become a fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, I was a civil servant rather than an academic. In this blog post I want to talk about why Government needs sustainable software, the work being done to deliver it, and the lessons we learnt after the first year. But Government already has sustainable software…\nThere’s quite a bit of disambiguation that needs to be done to the statement ‘Government needs sustainable software’. In fact, Government already has sustainable software, and lots of it. One need only look at alphagov, the GitHub organisation for the Government Digital Service. Sustainable, often open source, software is alive and well here, written by professional software developers, and in many other places in central and local Government alike. But this isn’t the whole story.\nThere are other parts of Government that write software, but like many in academia, you may have a hard time convincing them of this fact. In central Government (this is where my experience lies, so I will focus largely upon it) there are literally thousands of statisticians, operational researchers, social researchers, economists, scientists, and engineers. Any one of these may be writing code in a variety of languages in the course of their daily work, but don’t identify as software developers. It’s among these professions that there are tasks that will look most familiar to the academic researcher. Government statisticians in particular are tasked with producing periodic publications which incorporate data, visualisations, and analyses, much like academic outputs.\nSo in this blog post, I’m really talking about bespoke software that is used to create Government statistical publications."

    "title": "Why Government needs sustainable software too",
    "section": "Why sustainability is so important for Government",
    "text": "Why sustainability is so important for Government\nThe reasons for sustainability in academic publications have been well documented by the Software Sustainability Institute, but I would argue that it is even more important that Government writes reproducible and sustainable software for its statistical publications. Here’s why:\n\nThe outputs really matter\nI don’t want to downplay the importance of research outputs, publishing accurate science is critical to advancing human knowledge. What is different about research is that there is rarely a single source of truth. If a research group publishes a groundbreaking finding, we all take notice; but we don’t trust the findings until they have been replicated preferably by several other groups.\nIt’s not like that in Government. If a Government department publishes a statistic, in many cases that is the single source of truth, so it is critical that the statistics are both timely and accurate.\n\n\nPublications are often produced by multiple people\nThe second way that Government statistical publications differ from academic scientific publications is that they are often produced by a team of people that is regularly changing. This means that even at the point that it is being produced it needs to be easy for another member of the team to pick up the work and run with it. If someone goes on holiday, or is sick at the critical moment, their colleagues need to be able to pick up from where they left off immediately, and understand all the idiosyncrasies perfectly. The knowledge simply cannot rest in one person’s head.\nMore than that, since publications are often periodic (e.g. monthly, or annual) and analysts typically change role once a year, the work will very likely need to be handed off to someone new on a regular basis. It is essential therefore that these processes are well documented, and that the code that is being handed over works as expected.\n\n\nThe taxpayer pays for it\nObviously, the longer it takes a team of statisticians to produce a statistical report in Government, the more it costs to the taxpayer, and all Government departments have an interest in being efficient, and reducing unnecessary waste.\nAdditionally, since Government statistical publications are paid for by the public, where possible Government should be open and publish its workings. Coding in the open is already an important part of the culture among digital professions, adopting sustainable software practices allows statistical publications to be produced with the same openness.\n\n\nWorking towards sustainability\nI started working in Government as a Data Scientist after doing a PhD and post-doc in environmental science. I’d attended two Software Carpentry workshops during this time, and wrote my PhD in LaTeX and R. On joining Government it was clear that we could apply some of these lessons to improve the reporting workflow in Government.\nWorking with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) we had a first attempt at implementing a reproducible workflow for a statistical publication that was being produced with manual processes using a number of spreadsheets, a statistical computing package, and a word processor. We used RMarkdown to rewrite the publication, and abstracted the logic into an R package freely available on GitHub, complete with continuous integration from travis and appveyor.\nIn March of 2017 we published this work in a blog post, and worked hard to publicise this work with a large number of presentations and demonstrations to other Government departments. The prototype generated lots of interest; in particular an initial estimate that it could save 75% of the time taken to produce the same publication using the old methods.\nBy November we blogged again about successful trials of this approach in two further departments: the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Department for Education (DfE). We also produced a GitBook describing the various steps in more detail. Most of this is sensible software development practice; but it’s something that many Government analysts have not done before.\nBy the end of the year, the ideas had gained enough traction in the Government statistical community, that the Director General for the Office of Statistics Regulation (the body responsible for ensuring quality among official statistics) reported that this work was his favourite innovation of the year, although he wasn’t so keen on the name!\nWork continues to bring these techniques to a wider audience. There’s now a free online course built by one of my former colleagues to help civil servants get started, and a number of departments, particularly the MoJ are making great strides to incorporate these techniques into their workflows."

    "section": "Reproducibility is technical, sustainability is social",
    "text": "Reproducibility is technical, sustainability is social\nWe called the first prototype a ‘Reproducible Analytical Pipeline’ and acronym ‘RAP’ has stuck. This is not a very good name on reflection because it belies the main difficulty in transitioning from manual workflows into something more automated: making it sustainable. It’s very well creating beautiful, abstracted, replicable data workflows, but they are completely useless if no one knows how to use them, or to update them. That situation is more dangerous than the manual workflows that exist in many places at present, because at least the barrier to entry for tortuous manual processes is lower: you don’t need to know how to program to interpret a complicated spreadsheet, you just need a lot of patience.\nWhat this move from manual to automated implies is a recognition of the need for specialists; organisations will need to recruit specialists, make use of the ones they already have, and upskill other staff. This is a challenge that all organisations will need to rise to if they are to make these new methods stick.\nThis is likely to be less of a problem for academia, where within certain fields there is already an expectation that researchers will be able to use particular tools, and there may be more time to develop expertise away from operational pressures. However, there also exists a powerful disincentive: because journal articles are closer to ‘one off’ than a periodic report, it is less critical that researchers leave the code behind a paper in a good state, as they may never need to come back to it again."

    "text": "Senior buy-in is critical\nIn just over a year, we went from seeing an opportunity to scaling the idea across a number of Government departments, traditionally very conservative organisations. Getting the buy-in of senior officials was absolutely critical in our ability to get the idea accepted.\nIt’s important to realise early that senior managers are often interested in very different things to the users of the software, so messages need to be targeted to gain traction with the right audience. For instance, an incentive for managers in academia might be: mitigating the risk of errors that could lead to retraction, rather than by the expectation of cost savings."

    "section": "Time is money",
    "text": "Time is money\nOne of the reasons that we managed to make a big impact quickly is because Government departments are always keen to reduce costs. If a publication takes a team of four people a few weeks to produce, the cost quickly adds up. This is a feature of Government (and indeed industry) which is not shared by academia. Yes, it matters that work is delivered on time, but in my experience researcher time is a much more elastic resource. I was much more likely to work all evening or over the weekend as a PhD student or post doctoral researcher than I was as a civil servant; it was almost an expectation. For this reason, the financial imperative seems to be a much less powerful incentive in academia."

    "text": "It’s not all about the code\nNotwithstanding my comments about sustainability, it is important to note that reproducibility does not stop with reproducible code. We also need to worry about the data, and the environment. The former is particularly difficult in a Government setting, as one department often relies on another to provide the data, meaning that there is a less clear route to source than many academics enjoy. There are important initiatives underway in Government, such as GOV.UK Registers, which oversees the development of canonical lists of important information critical to the running of the country. Not all data can be treated in this way, and whilst taking snapshots of data may be a blunt instrument, it works when you don’t have control of where it comes from."

    "text": "Hello. My name is Julian and I am an R addict. I got hooked about 3 years ago when I took on a new role in Public Health England developing a public health data science team. My professional background is as a doctor and Consultant in Public Health and have spent the last 15 years in the health intelligence field so I thought I knew something about data and analysis. I realised I didn’t know anything about data science so I decided to do a course and ended up doing the Coursera data science MOOC from Johns Hopkins because it was health related. For the course, you need to learn R - and so my habit started. (It turned out I knew nothing about data and analysis as well).\nI had done an R course 15 years ago but never used it. Any analysis I did used spreadsheets, SPSS, Mapinfo and host of other tools, and I had never written a single line of code until 3 years ago (apart some very basic SQL). That’s all changed.\nApart from a brief obsession with Tableau a few years ago (which I still love), learning R has for me, been utterly transformational. Now my basic analytical workflow is R + Google (for getting answers when you are stuck) + Git (for sharing and storing code) + Mendeley (reference management software). That’s it.\nI barely open Excel except to look at data structure so I can import data into R; I don’t use GIS; I hardly even open word to write a document - I do that in R (like this blog); and recently the option to output to power point has appeared in R Markdown so I’ve started using that as well.\nOn top of that I have learned a whole heap of analytical and other skills through using R. I feel comfortable getting and analysing data of any size, shape and complexity including text, websites, APIs, very large datasets; and quickly. I can now rapidly produce scientific reports, scrape websites, mine text, automate analysis, build machine learning pipelines, create high quality graphics using the fab ggplot2 and its relatives, have co-authored a package to read Fingertips data (fingertipsR - very proud of this) and am getting my head around regular expressions. I have even managed a couple of Shiny documents. There is nothing I have wanted to do that I can’t do in R; and a huge range of things I didn’t know you could do or had never heard of.\nSo what is it about R that makes it so great? In the last 5 years it has moved from an academic stats package to a professional data science tool. One of the reasons is the development of the tidy data framework [1] and tools to make data wrangling or munging much easier. This is a much overlooked part of the analysts life - all the things you need to do with data before you can analyse it (50 - 70% of the process) has been paid serious attention and made much easier with packages like dplyr and tidyr. And a lot of attention has been made to making coding more logical and syntax more “English”. Another reason is the development of R Studio and R Markdown which give you button press outputs in a range of high quality formats. And there is a focus on reproducibility - the ability for analysis to be repeated exactly which requires combining data, analysis and results in a form others can follow. This is good science and will become much more widespread. You can do this in R and Git.\nMy addiction has infected my team and the analytical community in PHE. We are spreading R rapidly and writing packages to automate routine analysis and reporting. We routinely use Gitlab to share and collaborate on code, and are introducing software development ideas like code review and unit testing. In short we are trying to help analysts (if they want to) become analyst-developers.\nThere are downsides to R of course. There is a (big) learning curve, ICT get twitchy, there is a huge range of packages and any number of ways of doing things, and things often break. But as any addict would say, these are just obstacles to be overcome and there is a lot of support out there.\nR is not the only direction of travel - we do use PowerBI (running R scripts), and we do a bit of development in Python, but one thing is certain - I can’t go back to pre R days.\nSo there’s my confession. I’m a data junkie and an R addict. If you want to see my descent I put stuff on an RPubs page from time to time and I have a Github page. If you want to help me - feel free to get into touch or send me a pull request.\nThanks to Seb Fox at PHE and David Whiting of Medway Council for inspiration and support."

    "text": "What was the problem/challenge you were trying to address?\nHospital surgical teams regularly hold meetings to discuss cases and events that have happened in their departments. The patient data to be discussed can be complicated and varied, requiring analysts to manually go through many notes, reports and summaries in the electronic patient record system. By developing an extraction process and incorporating generalizable coding with R, this lengthy and manual process can be automated and can save valuable hours of analyst time.\n\n\nHow has R helped you? Any particular libraries/products/packages you found the most useful?\nR is a useful tool for this project as it allows for easy linkage of different datasets at the patient level and allows for informative visualisation. For example, a patient who is currently in the cardiology ward can easily be linked to their hospital admission history, previous procedures, laboratory results etc and the breadth of this information can be shown in an interactive time line plot using ggplot2 and plotly. As the data is extracted on a weekly basis, a {targets} pipeline has been beneficial in saving processing time and in compartmentalising the features and functions.\n\n\nWhat is the result?\nWe developed a targets pipeline which outputs a markdown report and a shiny app which displays the features required by the hospital department. A shiny app allows the department to interact with the data through selecting features and plotly timeline visualisations. Due to the ease of joining datasets together using R, more information can be provided and presented in the department meetings in an easy to understand format.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBriggs, Lydia. 2022. “Success Story - Dr Lydia Briggs, Data\nScientist, GOSH.” March 21, 2022. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/success-story-lydia-briggs.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Comparing dplyr with SQL nested queries\nFollowing on from my last post, where I demonstrated R to some first time R users, I want to do a wee comparison of dplyr V SQL, so that folks, particularly those in the NHS who might be R curious, can see just what the fuss is about.\nTo do so I want to recap on the example I showed at the AphA Scotland event.\nThis,in turn goes back to some work I’ve been doing with Neil Pettinger, where we are looking at ways to visualise patient flow.\nThis relies on a spreadsheet that Neil originally put together. Part of my demo was to explain how to recreate the visualisation in R, but I also showed some of the data transformation steps carried out using dplyr and some fellow tidyverse helpers.\nIn this post I want to focus on that a but further, by showing the SQL code I would write to arrive at the same end result.\nIn order to do this I imported Neil’s spreadsheet (which I’ve uploaded - with Neil’s permission to the repo RowOfDots) to into a SQL Server table (by using the built in import wizard, for a quick but not reproducible way of ingesting the data).\nHere’s how that looks:\n\nNB - ALL patient names are entirely made up.\nAs a reminder, for this task we need to create a column that mimics Excel’s floor function and reduces the MovementDateTime field to the nearest 15 mins. We also want to get a count of how many patient were either moving IN or OUT during each 15 minute segment of the day.\n\nSELECT [MovementDateTime],\n[FirstName],\n[LastName],\n[Ward_Dept],\n[Staging_Post],\n[Movement_Type],\n[IN_OUT],\ncast(round(floor(cast([MovementDateTime] AS float(53))*24*4)/(24*4),5) AS smalldatetime) AS Movement15,\n(CASE WHEN IN_OUT = 'IN' THEN 1 ELSE -1 END) AS [counter]\nFROM [DB].[dbo].[TABLENAME]\nGO\n\nYou’d need to replace the database and table names to suit. I’m not going to explain the code for flooring the datetime field - just know that it works, but you may want to compare the syntax for the case when statement with the equivalent dplyr code ( see later).\nHere is the table output - with the 2 new columns at the end:\n\nNow things get more complicated.\nI have a counter field, but I want to get a cumulative count by each 15 minute segment, staging post and whether this was a movement in or out.\nOne way to do this is to wrap the original query inside another query, so that our newly created counter column can be utilised. This is a similar idea to the the method of mutating a column in dplyr, and having it available within the next pipe.\nWe have to make use of SQL’s windowing functionality to create virtual groupings and orders within the data ( SQL is a set based language, and there is no concept of row order within a set. Therefore to get a cumulative count, we need to make SQL think in terms of rows by partitioning the data by the desired grouping columns and providing columns to order by):\n\nSELECT        x.[MovementDateTime],\nx.[FirstName],\nx.[LastName],\nx.[Ward_Dept],\nx.[Staging_Post],\nx.[Movement_Type],\nx.[IN_OUT],\nx.[Movement15],\nx.[counter],\nROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY IN_OUT, Movement_Type,Staging_Post,Movement15 ORDER BY (MovementDateTime))AS R_Number\nFROM\n(SELECT [MovementDateTime],\n[FirstName],\n[LastName],\n[Ward_Dept],\n[Staging_Post],\n[Movement_Type],\n[IN_OUT],\ncast(round(floor(cast([MovementDateTime] AS float(53))*24*4)/(24*4),5) AS smalldatetime) AS Movement15,\n(CASE WHEN IN_OUT = 'IN' THEN 1 ELSE -1 END) AS [counter]\nFROM [DB].[dbo].[TABLENAME])x\nUnderstanding windowing techniques is a great SQL skill to have. Don’t forget where you first saw this ;)!\n\nUnderstanding windowing techniques is a great SQL skill to have. Don’t forget where you first saw this ;)!\nA couple of things to note here are that when we wrap or “nest” the original query, I gave it the alias ‘x’. You do need to provide an alias for this inner query, or the outer query won’t work. Although not strictly necessary, I also prefixed the column names in the outer query so it’s clear that I am selecting the columns from the “virtual” table defined by the inner query.\nHere’s the output with our new Row number (or RNumber) field.\n\nAlmost done, but this is still not in the right format - I need to get an accurate cumulative count. Once more, I take the previous query, and nest that inside a new query - so you can see this is similar to lots of base R style manipulation where the code starts from the middle, or an end, and works back.\n\nSELECT y.MovementDateTime,\ny.FirstName,\ny.LastName,\ny.Ward_Dept,\ny.Staging_Post,\ny.Movement_Type,\ny.IN_OUT,\ny.Movement15,\ny.[counter],\ny.[counter] * y.R_Number AS Movement_15_SEQNO\nFROM (\nSELECT x.MovementDateTime,\nx.FirstName,\nx.LastName,\nx.Ward_Dept,\nx.Staging_Post,\nx.Movement_Type,\nx.IN_OUT,\nx.Movement15,\nx.[counter],\nROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY IN_OUT, Movement_Type,Staging_Post,Movement15 ORDER BY (MovementDateTime))AS R_Number\nFROM\n(SELECT [MovementDateTime],\n[FirstName],\n[LastName],\n[Ward_Dept],\n[Staging_Post],\n[Movement_Type],\n[IN_OUT],\ncast(round(floor(cast([MovementDateTime] AS float(53))*24*4)/(24*4),5) AS smalldatetime) AS Movement15,\n(CASE WHEN IN_OUT = 'IN' THEN 1 ELSE -1 END) AS [counter]\nFROM [DB].[dbo].[TABLENAME])x) y\nORDER BY MovementDateTime\nGO\n\nTo recap - our first query floored the movement time to 15 minute intervals and gave us a counter field, we then used that counter field to generate a row number field. Now, even if I’d ordered the result of the second query by MovementDateTime, it still wouldn’t suffice because the rownumbers are all positive, and I want them to be negative when the movement was a movement OUT.\nWe can’t manipulate the row number field within the same query that it is created, so we nest the whole lot once more, this time arranging in the correct time order and multiplying the counter field by our row number field.\nYou’ll notice the second query has been aliased (with a ‘y’) and the columns prefixed so that is is clear exactly where the query is obtaining the data from.\nThis gives us our final output:\n\nA reminder of the dplyr code I used:\n\nplot_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\nmutate(Movement15 = lubridate::floor_date(MovementDateTime,\"15 minutes\")) %&gt;%\ngroup_by(IN_OUT, Movement_Type,Staging_Post,Movement15) %&gt;%\nmutate(counter = case_when(\nIN_OUT == 'IN' ~ 1,\nIN_OUT == 'OUT' ~ -1)) %&gt;%\nmutate(Movement_15_SEQNO = cumsum(counter)) %&gt;%\nungroup()\n\nAnd here is the output - compare with above:\n\nA lot more elegant? Definitely.\nAnother approach to writing the code in SQL would be to use a Common Table Expression, which is a more straightforward of writing and reading it. It’s a similar idea in that you create virtual tables with queries that then run top to bottom until you get your final output. However that is a post for another day :)\nWhat I hope you get from this post is that dplyr and other packages (lubridate for example) really do make life easier for data manipulation.\nLook at the SQL for flooring the date, compared to the lubridate call. Look at the elegance of mutating new columns and having them available within the next chain, compared to horrendous multi-layered nested queries (this one was pretty tame - imagine a few more levels on top of that). You can see how traditional SQL can get unwieldy.\nDplyr is a fantastic asset to the R community, and I hope it might prove to be a great hook to get R further established within the analytical departments of the NHS.\nThis blog was written by John MacKintosh, NHS data analyst based in Inverness, Scotland, and was originally posted on his blog site [johnmackintosh.net]](https://johnmackintosh.net/blog/2018-05-31-dplyr-for-the-win/).\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMacKintosh, John. 2018. “Simpler SQL with Dplyr.” June 7,\n2018. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/simpler-sql-with-dplyr.html."

The main difference is that we use a geom_point() geometry and set the colour of the points based on whether the said point deviates above and below the average. In addition, we use the geom_text() to set the colour of the text in the points to white and specify the size of the text. The final difference is that I have added a Y limit (ylim) range of -2.5 standard deviation to positive 2.5 standard deviations.\nRunning this block of code, along with the data preparation code, will give you a chart that looks as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Diverging Lollipop Chart\nThe code below shows how to build the diverging lollipop chart in R and ggplot2:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x=CarBrand, y=mpg_z_score, label=mpg_z_score)) +\n  geom_point(stat='identity', aes(col=mpg_type), size=6) +\n  scale_color_manual(name=\"Mileage (deviation)\",\n                     labels = c(\"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"),\n                     values = c(\"above\"=\"#00ba38\", \"below\"=\"#0b8fd3\")) +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = 0,\n                   x = CarBrand,\n                   yend = mpg_z_score,\n                   xend = CarBrand),\n               color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(color=\"white\", size=2) +\n  labs(title=\"Diverging Lollipop Chart\",\n       subtitle=\"Z score for normalised mileage\",\n       caption=\"Produced by Gary Hutson\") +\n  ylim(-2.5, 2.5) + coord_flip() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor =\n  element_blank())\n\nSimilar geometries are used here. What has been added here is the geom_segment() this shows how the line segments need to be added. The starting y is equal to 0 on the Y scale and the starting x is the first car by the car brand. Similarly, the end of the x (xend) is also the CarBrand.\nThe only other difference is to add a theme constraint to the end of the code to turn off the major and minor grid lines, this is achieved by setting the panel.grid.major and panel.grid.minor equal to element_blank().\nThe completed graph and plot is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere – we now have some lovely looking charts that can be put into a report to report on variance between categorical variables.\nThis blog was written by Gary Hutson, Principal Analyst, Activity & Access Team, Information & Insight at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and was originally posted at Hutsons-Hacks.\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHutson, Gary. 2018. “Diverging Dot Plot and Lollipop Charts –\nPlotting Variance with Ggplot2.” May 24, 2018. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/diverging-dot-plot-and-lollipop-charts-plotting-variance-with-ggplot2.html."

Out of interest, I wanted to find out how much the ticket cost per day, taking into account I don’t use it on weekends or my paid holidays. I started my workings out initially in Excel but got as far as typing the formula =WORKDAYS() before I realised it was going to take some working out and perhaps I should give it a go in R as a function…\nChris Beeley had recently shown me functions in R and I was surprised how familiar they were as I’ve seen them on Stack Overflow (usually skimmed over those) and they are similar to functions in SQL which I’ve used (not written) where you feed in parameters.\nWhen I write code I try to work out how each part works and build it up but writing a function requires running the whole thing and then checking the result, the objects that are created in the function do not materialise so are never available to check. Not having objects building up in the environment console is one of the benefits of using a function, that and not repeating scripts which then ALL need updating if something changes."

    "section": "Going through each line:",
    "text": "Going through each line:\nTo make sure each part within the function works it’s best to write it in another script or move the bit betweeen the curly brackets {}.\nFirstly, the startDate is self explanatory but within the function I’ve set the endDate to be dependent upon the startDate and be automatically 1 year later.\nOriginally when I was trying to find the “year after” a date I found some documentation about {lubridate}’s function dyear():\n\n# Next couple of lines needed to run the endDate line!\nlibrary(lubridate)\nstartDate &lt;- dmy(\"11/07/2019\")\n\nendDate &lt;- startDate + dyears(1)\n\nbut this gives an exact year after a given date and doesn’t take into account leap years. I only remember this because 2020 will be a leap year so the end date I got was a day out!\nInstead, Chris Beeley suggested the following:\n\nendDate &lt;- as.Date(startDate) %m+% months(12)\n\nNext, the code builds a sequence of days. I got this idea of building up the days from the blogs on getting days between two dates but it has also come in use when plotting over time in things like SPCs when some of the time periods are not in the dataset but would make sense appearing as 0 count.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# To run so that the sequencing works\n# using as.Date() returns incorrect date formats 0011-07-20 so use dmy from\n# lubridate to transform the date\n\n  startDate &lt;- dmy(\"11/07/2019\")\n  endDate &lt;- as.Date(startDate) %m+% months(12)\n\n# Now build a sequence between the dates:\n  myDates &lt;- seq(from = startDate, to = endDate, by = \"days\")\n\nAll of these return values so trying to open them from the Global Environment won’t do anything. It is possible view the first parts of the values but also typing:\n\n# compactly displays the structure of object, including the format (date in this case)\nstr(myDates)\n\n Date[1:367], format: \"2019-07-11\" \"2019-07-12\" \"2019-07-13\" \"2019-07-14\" \"2019-07-15\" ...\n\n# gives a summary of the structure\nsummary(myDates)\n\n        Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max. \n\"2019-07-11\" \"2019-10-10\" \"2020-01-10\" \"2020-01-10\" \"2020-04-10\" \"2020-07-11\" \n\n\nTo find out what a function does type ?str or?summary in the console. The help file will then appear in the bottom right Help screen.\nNext I worked out working_days. I got the idea from a blog which said to use length and which:\n\n  working_days &lt;- length(which((wday(myDates)&gt;1&wday(myDates)&lt;7)))\n\nNote that the value appears as 262L which is a count of a logical vector. Typing ?logical into the Console gives this in the Help:\nLogical vectors are coerced to integer vectors in contexts where a numerical value is required, with TRUE being mapped to 1L, FALSE to 0L and NA to NA_integer._\nI was familiar with length(), it does a count essentially of factors or vectors (type ?length into the Console for information) but which() wasn’t something I knew about. Chris Beeley explained what which does with the following example:\n\n# Generate a list of random logical values\na &lt;- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 10, replace = TRUE)\n\n# Look at list\na\n\n [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n# using which against the list gives the number in the list where the logic = TRUE\nwhich(a)\n\n[1] 2 6 9\n\n# counts how many logical arguments in the list (should be 10)\nlength(a)\n\n[1] 10\n\n# counts the number of TRUE logical arguments\nlength(which(a))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThen Chris Beeley suggested just using sum instead of length(which()) which counts a logical vector:\n\nsum(a)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nIt seems this has been discussed on Stack Overflow before: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2190756/how-to-count-true-values-in-a-logical-vector\nIt’s worthy of note that using sum will also count NAs so the example on Stack overflow suggest adding:\n\nsum(a, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThis won’t affect the objects created in this blog as there were no NAs in them but it’s just something that could cause a problem if used in a different context.\n\n  working_days &lt;- sum(wday(myDates)&gt;1&wday(myDates)&lt;7)\n\n# Just to check adding na.rm = TRUE gives the same result\n  working_days &lt;- sum(wday(myDates)&gt;1&wday(myDates)&lt;7, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nI then wanted to take into account bank/public holidays as I wouldn’t use the ticket on those days so I used the function holidayLONDON( from the package {timeDate}:\n\nlength(holidayLONDON(year = lubridate::year(startDate)))\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nI used lubridate::year because the package {timeDate} uses a parameter called year so the code would read year = year(startDate) which is confusing to me let alone the function!\nAgain, I counted the vectors using length(). This is a crude way of getting bank/public holidays as it is looking at a calendar year and not a period (July to July in this case).\nI did look at a package called {bizdays} but whilst that seemed to be good for building a calendar I couldn’t work out how to make it work so I just stuck with the {timeDate} package. I think as I get more confident in R it might be something I could look into the actual code for because all packages are open source and available to view through CRAN or GitHub.\nBack to the function…\nI then added - EmployHoliday so I could reduce the days by my paid holidays and - wfh to take into account days I’ve worked from home and therefore not travelled into work.\nThe next part of the code takes the entered Cost and divides by the Working_days, printing the output to the screen:\nper_day &lt;- Cost/working_days\nprint(per_day)\nAnd so the answer to the cost per day is printed in the Console:\n\nDailyBusFare_function(\"11/07/2019\",27,612,1)\n\n[1] 2.707965"

    "text": "A few years ago Mohammed A Mohammed, who was integral to getting NHS-R Community set up, suggested I might like to get involved by creating a website for NHS-R Community. At that time I had no idea where to start so my involvement stalled and a website was built, with help from a 3rd party, in WordPress. WordPress is a great website tool that can support very complicated sites like NHS-R Community’s, as we have both a static site and an Events Management system which means that we don’t need to rely (or pay!) for Eventbrite. We’ve used the system for sign up to hundreds of webinars and workshops, not to mention several hundred people attending conferences over the years.\n\n\nIn the time it’s taken from that initial suggestion about building the website to now, where I help to manage the site, I’ve had the opportunity to build websites for myself using {distill} and Hugo Apéro as well as the release of Quarto which I was incredibly keen to try out for website creation.\nI’d used Quarto for slides and reports and been hugely impressed with it. Getting started with Quarto is relatively easy if you’ve coded for a while, but like with anything, you have to start off at the basics and quickly want more complex functionality as you get going. This is even more of an issue when you are moving from one system to another and it’s more of a translation than a build-from-scratch project.\n\n\nAlthough Quarto has come from the R side of coding it can be used by any other language coder as it supports Python, Julia and Observable. Quarto output can be built in RStudio but equally as easily in other programs like VS Code.\nLuckily for me, many people had already jumped into Quarto websites and their code was available online to delve into. I particularly was keen to follow the work of the Brian Tarran for the Royal Statistical Society’s Real World Data Science website because, at first glance, this doesn’t give itself away as being built on Quarto! And I also really like Silvia Canelón’s personal blog site for its beauty and functionality. Silvia has particularly worked hard on accessibility of her website and has written a lot of CSS code which I’m learning through what she has shared.\nAccessibility is something that the WordPress site needed considerable work on, particularly when checked with a website called the Web Accessbility Evaluation Tool which Silvia recommends on her blog site. The new Quarto site will need this too of course but now that the code is out in the open, anyone can contribute. That can be either making changes to the code but also highlighting problems as issues that can then be open to everyone to view.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll mention accessibility again as that’s hugely important and I like the fact that the people working on Quarto also think a lot about accessibility. Adding alt text has never been easier and any code (in the YAML) that refers to an image nearly always has functionality to add image alt text too.\n\n\n\nThe search function for Quarto books is really impressive and the same functionality can be found in Quarto websites. There might be a plug in within WordPress to make searching through blogs for particular words but with Quarto it’s not something that needs adding - it’s there from the start. I now no longer have to think about tags or categories for blogs to make them easier to find (and then remember them to find the blogs which is the trickier part for me!).\n\n\n\nThis was a bit of a niggle with WordPress in that it’s not really a website for coders to show their code examples (although there may be a plug in for that!). Quarto handles code snippets and examples by beautifully formatting it to look different to text but also runs the code for you if you want. It’s meant that the charts that are talked about in some blogs are produced as the code is run, not as static pictures that also can’t be copied easily as a picture doesn’t give the functionality for highlighting to copy.\nUsually a blogger will choose a nice image to complement their writing and Quarto gives that functionality but I had a lovely surprise when charts that are created by the blog code became the thumbnail image automatically.\n\n\n\nHaving a website that can publish R or Python code is an absolute joy. I used to write blogs in RMarkdown, render them to html and then copy the output to WordPress and in the copying and pasting often lost links or formatting.\nBeing open to contribution of course also means that the repository will be available to people to do pull requests. I’ve set the repository so that it’s not necessary to Render the website to contribute so any additions or changes just need to be made to the qmd files.\n\n\n\nNow this point could have come from any change in website but I’ve taken the opportunity to go through each blog and transfer it to Quarto. There are no doubt quicker ways to do this as I can export from WordPress and then work on code to to get it to a format that can be published, but I started with moving a couple of blogs to get started and I’ve really enjoyed this even though it takes a bit more time to do.\nStarting in 2018 when the blogs first started I didn’t know R at all. I started learning with NHS-R Community so these early blogs meant very little to me at the time. As I’ve gone through each blog, formatting them and checking the R code runs (I found a couple of tiny mistakes this way) and the links still work I’ve been more like an archivist than a coder. My favourite discovery, and shock, was that I found that RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines) was shared with the NHS-R Community in 2018 although I only really heard about it from 2020. It was very much like the moment I experienced when I went through my old Geography school books and found I’d been taught in those lessons about Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) but I had absolutely no recollection of it at all! It hadn’t been the right time for me to really hear about it and yet in time, it’s become something that I now really love working with. You can read more about IMD in a Quarto collaborative book for NHS-R Community called Health Inequalities.\n\n\n\n\nKnowing where to start with contributions can be a barrier so I’ve written out a few things to try to help people do this. Firstly, our Quarto book (yes another one - they are additive be warned!)

    "text": "I work as a Data Scientist at Public Health England. I am part of a small team that have a role in trying to modernise how we “do” data. I have been an analyst in one way or another for most of my working life. In my role as an analyst, as with most analysts, my biggest focus was on the accuracy of my outputs, but I’ve always got frustrated very quickly with repetitive tasks, which are all too common for analytical roles. In fact, I remember when these frustrations first began. It was during my Masters when, as part of my dissertation, my supervisor asked me to draw a map using ArcMap software. I hadn’t had any previous experience of the software before this moment. Instead of asking for help, which I should have done, I went away and tried to import the files I was given. What I didn’t know was that I didn’t have access to the correct licence to import the files I was using. I thought I was doing something wrong. I did manage to open the files in Excel though and I could see they contained coordinates. I could see that if I interpolated the coordinates of the points, I could create a file that I would be able to upload into ArcMap and it would look like what I was aiming for - the problem was that there were millions of coordinates and they were split over multiple files! This is the moment in my life where I discovered “Record Macro”. I managed to record a few instances of what I wanted to do, and then manipulated the recorded code to repeat the task for everything. I felt very smug going to my supervisor the following week and handing him a map with pink, yellow and red blobs illustrating height contours of a water basin. To say he wasn’t impressed would be an understatement. He pulled up a map on his screen to show me what it should look like. His screen essentially showed what Google Satellite now provides us. My smugness quickly turned to self-doubt.\nIn many ways this example is typical of my experience as an analyst. I have received data in many ways, from people or through systems and databases, but to manipulate (or wrangle, as it is commonly called now) those data to what my manager wanted to see would take a number of days. The data may contain a table for each month, where each month was a different tab in a spreadsheet. If I was lucky each tab would be formatted identically, but more often than not there would be different numbers of columns or rows (sigh). Sometimes, one month might (helpfully) have an extra blank row at the top or maybe some merged cells. I would sit there bringing all those data into one place thinking of myself as part of a sandwich assembly line, picking up all the raw ingredients, assembling them in the right way for somebody else to enjoy. I really wanted to enjoy it! Surely this can be done better and faster. How did analysts on detective shows instantly get the information the senior detective required at the tap of a few keys?\nI first used R 3 years ago. R has completely changed the way that I see data. It has formalised all my previous frustrations. It has words for things that I have thought but could never explain. It encourages data to be “done” properly. Before R I had never heard of an analytical pipeline (I realise this isn’t exclusively an R thing). Everything I had done was about getting data, spending time wrangling it, analysing it and finally presenting it to someone else (for their enjoyment). R gave me R Markdown. Here I could do all of these steps in one script. There was no need for me to write a Word document to sit alongside my Excel workbook to explain where I got the data from, what tabs 2 to 7 do, and why I’ve hard-coded 34.84552 in cell D4. There was no need for me to write step by step instructions for how to draw a bar chart on one axis and a line chart on another within the same graph. The ability to become transparent in my workings was ideal for my lazy nature as the description is written in the code. Not only was my working transparent, it was also completely reproducible. If someone else had access to the same data as me, they could run my script and it would produce the same outputs.\nMy biggest revelation though was being introduced to tidy data. This was my game changer. I had often heard the quote that analysts spent 80% of their time manipulating data and 20% analysing it. That chimed with me. As is written in the paper referenced above:\n“tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way”\nAs the paper describes, tidy data has three features:\nEach variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\nIt is hard to describe or appreciate this really until you think about the dataset you’re working with. Are you really struggling to get it into the format you need to make it easy to work with? The example the paper provides can be seen below:\n\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nuntidy_data &lt;- tibble::tribble(\n  ~person, ~treatmentA, ~treatmentB,\n  \"John Smith\",          NA,          2L,\n  \"Jane Doe\",         16L,         11L,\n  \"Mary Johnson\",          3L,          1L\n)\n\n\ngt(untidy_data)\n\n\n\n\n\nperson\ntreatmentA\ntreatmentB\n\n\n\nJohn Smith\nNA\n2\n\n\nJane Doe\n16\n11\n\n\nMary Johnson\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\ntidy_data &lt;- untidy_data |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"treatmentA\", \"treatmentB\"),\n               names_to = \"treatment\",\n               values_to = \"result\") |&gt; \n  arrange(treatment)\n\ngt(tidy_data)\n\n\n\n\n\nperson\ntreatment\nresult\n\n\n\nJohn Smith\ntreatmentA\nNA\n\n\nJane Doe\ntreatmentA\n16\n\n\nMary Johnson\ntreatmentA\n3\n\n\nJohn Smith\ntreatmentB\n2\n\n\nJane Doe\ntreatmentB\n11\n\n\nMary Johnson\ntreatmentB\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1, the table on above illustrates an untidily formatted table. The table below presents the same data but in tidy format\nAs an analyst, working with tidy data is a rare pleasure. Analytical tasks become seamless as it allows you to use the tidyverse package. Summarising data for groups within your dataset or creating models based on subgroups are an additional one or two lines of understandable code rather than 20 to 30.\nI look forward to a world where tidy data becomes the norm. In this world analysts will be spending 80% of their time analysing the data. We will be using data in a timely fashion, and it will be informing decision making even more than it currently does. We will be combining different datasets to create fuller pictures for the decisions we are informing. We will be learning new techniques for analysing the data rather than new techniques for manipulating them. Wrangling will become a thing of the past and most importantly, we will get to enjoy the sandwich that we’ve made.\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFox, Sebastian. 2018. “Aiming for a Wrangle-Free (or Reduced)\nWorld.” March 23, 2018. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/aiming-for-a-wrangle-free-or-reduced-world.html."

    "title": "Diverging Bar Charts – Plotting Variance with ggplot2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Diverging Bar Charts\nThe aim here is to create a diverging bar chart that shows variance above and below an average line. In this example I will use Z Scores to calculate the variance, in terms of standard deviations, as a diverging bar. This example will use the mtcars stock dataset, as most of the data I deal with day-to-day is patient sensitive.\nData preparation\nThe code below sets up the plotting libraries, attaches the data and sets a theme:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\ndata(\"mtcars\") # load data\n\nNext, we will change some of the columns in the data frame and perform some calculations on the data frame:\n\nmtcars$CarBrand &lt;- rownames(mtcars) # Create new column for car brands and names\n\nAs commented, this line uses the existing mtcars data frame and uses the dollar sign notation i.e. add a new column, or refer to a column, to create a column name called CarBrand. Then we assign the car brand (&lt;-) with the rownames from the data frame. This is obviously predicated on there being some row names in the data frame, otherwise you would have to name the rows using rownames().\nAdding a Z Score calculation\nA Z score is a calculation which uses the x observation subtracts said observation from the mean and divides by the standard deviation. The link shows the mathematics behind this, for anyone who is interested.\nThe following code shows how we would implement this score:\n\nmtcars$mpg_z_score &lt;- round((mtcars$mpg - mean(mtcars$mpg))/sd(mtcars$mpg), digits=2)\n\nThe statistics behind the calculation have already been explained, but I have also used the round() function to round the results down to 2 digits.\nCreating a cut off (above/below mean)\nThe next step is to use conditional algebra (first advocated by one of my heroes George Boole) to check whether the Z score I have just created is greater or less than 0:\n\nmtcars$mpg_type &lt;- ifelse(mtcars$mpg_z_score &lt;= 0, \"below\", \"above\")\n\nThe ifelse() block looks at whether the Z Score is below 0, if so tag as below average, otherwise show this as above.\nThe next two steps are to convert the Car Brand into a unique factor and to sort by the Z Score calculations:\nNow, I have everything I need to start to compute the plot. Great stuff, so let’s get plotting.\n\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg_z_score), ] #Ascending sort on Z Score\nmtcars$CarBrand &lt;- factor(mtcars$CarBrand, levels = mtcars$CarBrand)\n\nCreating the plot\nFirst, I will start with creating the base plot:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x=CarBrand, y=mpg_z_score, label=mpg_z_score))\n\nHere, I pass in the mtcars data frame and set the aesthetics layer (aes) of the x axis to the brand of car (CarBrand). The y axis is the Z score I created for miles per gallon (mpg) and the label is also set to the z score.\nNext, I will add on the geom_bar geometry:\n\n    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=CarBrand, y=mpg_z_score, label=mpg_z_score)) +\n    geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=mpg_type), width=.5) +\n\nThis indicates that I need to use the mpg_z_score field by forcing the stat=\"identity\" option. If this was not added, then it would simply count the number of times the Car Brand appears as a frequency count (not what I want!). Then, I stipulate the fill type of the bar to be equal to whether the value deviates above and below 0 – remember we created a field in the data preparation stage to store whether this deviates below and above 0 and called it mpg_type. The last parameter is the width parameter to indicate the width of the bars.\nNext:\n\n  ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=CarBrand, y=mpg_z_score, label=mpg_z_score)) +\n   geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=mpg_type), width=.5) +\n   scale_fill_manual(name=\"Mileage (deviation)\",\n                    labels = c(\"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"),\n                    values = c(\"above\"=\"#00ba38\", \"below\"=\"#0b8fd3\")) +\n\nI use the scale_fill_manual() ggplot option to add the name to the legend, specify the label names using the combine function and stipulate that the values that are above average need to be hex coded by the value and the below values to a different code. I have weirdly chosen blue and green as an alternative to red, as I know we have accessibility there. We are nearly there, the final step is:\n\n ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=CarBrand, y=mpg_z_score, label=mpg_z_score)) +\n   geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=mpg_type), width=.5) +\n   scale_fill_manual(name=\"Mileage (deviation)\",\n                    labels = c(\"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"),\n                    values = c(\"above\"=\"#00ba38\", \"below\"=\"#0b8fd3\")) +\n   labs(subtitle=\"Z score (normalised) mileage for mtcars'\",\n         title= \"Diverging Bar Plot (ggplot2)\", caption=\"Produced by Gary Hutson\") +\n   coord_flip()\n\nHere, I have added the labs layer on to the plot. This is a way to label your plots to show more meaningful values than would be included by default. So, within labs I use subtitle, title and caption to add labels to the chart. Finally, the important command is to add the coord_flip() command to the chart – without this you would have vertical bars instead of horizontal. I think this type of chart looks better horizontal, thus the reason for the inclusion of the command.\nThe final chart, looks as illustrated hereunder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog was written by Gary Hutson, Principal Analyst, Activity & Access Team, Information & Insight at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and was originally posted at Hutson-Hacks.\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHutson, Gary. 2018. “Diverging Bar Charts – Plotting Variance with\nGgplot2.” May 24, 2018. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/diverging-bar-charts-plotting-variance-with-ggplot2.html."

That leaves us to have fun with the plot.\nBuilding the Histogram with auto binning\nI set up the plot, as per below:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\n\nI import the ggplot2 library and set my chart theme to a classic theme. The process next is to create the histogram plot and feed in the relevant data:\n\nplot &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Blues\")\n\nI create a plot placeholder in memory so I can reuse this plot again and again in memory. This sets the aes layer equal to the displacement metric in the mtcars data frame. I then use the scale_fill_brewer command and select the palette to the Blues palette. A list of palettes can be found on the R Graph Gallery.\n\nThe next section uses the geom_histogram() geometry to force this to be a histogram:\n\nplot + geom_histogram(aes(fill=class),\n                      binwidth = .1,\n                      col=\"black\",\n                      size=.1) +\n  labs(title=\"Histogram with Auto Binning\",\n       caption=\"Produced by Gary Hutson\") + xlab(\"Displacement\")\n\nThe histogram uses the class of vehicle as the histogram fill, the binwidth is the width of the bins required, the colour is equal to black and the size is stipulated here. All that I then do is add the data labels to it and you have a lovely looking histogram built. This can be applied to any dataset. The output is as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying binning values\nThe script can be simply changed in the histogram layer by adding the bins parameter:\n\nplot + geom_histogram(aes(fill=class),\n                   bins=5,\n                   col=\"black\",\n                   size=.1) +\n  labs(title=\"Histogram with Auto Binning\",\n       caption=\"Produced by Gary Hutson\") + xlab(\"Displacement\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog was written by Gary Hutson, Principal Analyst, Activity & Access Team, Information & Insight at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and was originally posted on Hutsons-Hacks.\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHutson, Gary. 2018. “Histogram with Auto Binning in\nGgplot2.” May 24, 2018. https://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/histogram-with-auto-binning-in-ggplot2.html."

    "text": "Hello and welcome to our nascent NHS-R Community; a community dedicated to promoting the learning, application and utilisation of R in the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. Like any community, NHS-R relies on the vibrancy of its participants to be relevant and productive – and fun.\n\n\nThe NHS is one of the best healthcare systems in the world[1]. It was launched in 1948 with the guiding principle of being free at the point of delivery – a kind of crowd funded open-source freeware equivalent of healthcare. More than half (52%) of the public say the NHS is what makes them most proud to be British, placing it above the armed forces (47%), the Royal Family (33%), Team GB (26%) and the BBC (22%)1.\nThe NHS in England deals with about 1 million people every 36 hours[2] and is continually generating vast amounts of data about the health and care of people[3]. This data is one of the most precious, yet under tapped, resources in the NHS. “Data is the new oil of the digital economy”[4] and drilling and mining NHS data could improve the NHS[5]. But mining these mountains of data is a colossal task.\nThis is where R comes in. R was conceived in 1992[6] as a free open-source statistical programming environment, which is now widely used in industry[7] (Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, New York Times, Lloyds of London, etc) and academia, and is now ranked amongst the most popular (sixth as of 2017) programming languages[8]. But its use in the NHS is almost non-existent. Whilst there are several reasons for this, the absence of R at scale in the NHS, means that the NHS is unable to take advantage of the huge benefits of R, including cutting-edge visualisation and statistical tools, and a worldwide R community, which freely shares learning and resources.\nSo, our aim is to promote the use of R in the NHS, and help to make the NHS better.\nTo kick-start the NHS-R Community, we have developed a website [www.nhsrcommunity.com] and are offering four free workshops (3 days each, repeated in Yorkshire and Wales). Workshop (1) will be an introduction to R for healthcare analysts. Subsequent workshops will focus on the following problems:- (2) understanding and reporting hospital mortality statistics, (3) predicting urgent demand for hospital care and (4) evaluation of interventions using matched retrospective controls. Each workshop will be led by experts in both the problem domain and R, and captured electronically for wider dissemination. Registration for the workshops is now open*.\nHowever, anyone can contribute to the NHS-R Community, so why not share your experience (novice, beginner, or otherwise) of using R in the healthcare setting? Write a blog, share R tips, do an on-line R tutorial, suggest topics for ongoing development and support, and share ideas on how to embed R into the NHS.\nFrom the NHS-R Team [Posted: 19 March 2018]\nThe NHS-R Community project is funded by The Health Foundation.\n*NB: To be eligible for the workshops you must have a working NHS email address. Places are limited.\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2140698-us-ranked-worst-healthcare-system-while-the-nhs-is-the-best/ Accessed 20240221\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx Accessed 20240221\nhttps://www.wired.com/insights/2014/07/data-new-oil-digital-economy/ Accessed 20240221\nhttp://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/10/updated-history-of-r.html Accessed 20240221\nhttp://makemeanalyst.com/companies-using-r/ Accessed 20240221\nhttps://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages Accessed 20240221"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tell us a bit about yourself, your team and how your story begins?\nThe Health Intelligence team at the British Heart Foundation just about still qualifies as a ‘new’ team at the stately age of 2-and-a-bit years. Our remit is to collate and analyse a wide range of data related to cardiovascular disease and its treatment and outcomes across the UK and use this to provide critical insight and context to the BHF’s charitable mission work. Some of our work is population focussed, understanding the patterns and trends in CVD prevalence and incidence. Some is more system focussed, getting under the skin of variation in care for CVD patients and learning more about how patients are impacted by service change. And still more is supporting particular programmes of work, such as the National Defibrillator Network or our community mobilisation projects. You’ll see our numbers in BHF adverts and occasionally one of us gets wheeled out to talk stats on local radio. Lots to do! We’re a small team, just 5.5 people, serving a large organisation so we need to work smart.\n\n\nWhat was the problem/challenge you were trying to address?\nCVD is a complex and varied group of illnesses and the data describing it can be very nuanced. Pair that with an organisation that needs to use it for comms and media work, as well as informing strategy and programmes of work and the result is the need for a hybrid model of delivery that does the basics brilliantly, allows for easy ‘self serve’ and frees up time to support colleagues with the complex stuff. So our challenge was to build a library of core resources for internal use, as automated as possible and presented in an accessible format for all colleagues to use.\n\n\nHow R helped you? Any particular libraries/products/packages you found the most useful?\nR has been invaluable in the whole project to date (still lots to do!) but two specific resources spring to mind. Firstly, the Tidyverse suite of packages has been invaluable in streamlining, and making repeatable, our data reshaping. Much of the publicly available data we use is downloaded from websites and is (ahem) not exactly in a useful format. Having standardised, and generally very simple, reshaping scripts to reuse across the team has saved hours of time, not to mention to ability to automate the download in the first place (kudos to ::curl::).\nSecondly, we have utilised R Markdown extensively in the automated production of simple off-the-(Sharepoint)-shelf PDF based reports. Accessible to all, impossible to break (famous last words) these generally take the form of a key set of data visualisations of a specific topic, usually rendered using ggplot2 but also using network visualisation packages (::network::, ::igraph::, ::tidygraph:: ) and n-gram analysis of text data (::tidytext::) where required.\n\n\nWhat is the result?\nThe beginnings of a library accessible to all in the BHF and a decent chunk of time saved. A couple of our reports are scheduled to run and publish automatically with zero intervention from the team outside of checking it’s there. We’ve used R in other standalone projects (e.g. forecasting work, network analysis as part of an evaluation project) too. We’re in the process of improving our R capability, in terms of skills and in terms of infrastructure, so this is really just the start of the story for us.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCheema, Kate. 2022. “Success Story - Kate Cheema, Director of\nHealth Intelligence, British Heart Foundation.” March 21, 2022.\nhttps://nhs-r-community.github.io/nhs-r-community//blog/success-story-kate-cheema.html."

To ensure that the codebase is: interpretable, reusable & maintainable and to control technical debt around the solutions we provide, so that they can be handed over to other technical teams in the Trust.\n\n\nThe Solution:\nWe have created a ‘Data Science’ template, inspired by Cookiecutter Data Science and using the targets R package to logically break down code into small reusable chunks applied to our research datasets.\n\n\nThe Results:\nWe are now running (and have completed) a number of projects from estimation of surgery lengths with XGBOOST, to dashboarding cardiac data for MDTs, to creating articles on historic data trends at GOSH and many more.

In a situation where you have multiple packages with functions with the same name loaded, R will use the the function from the package you loaded the latest. As you can imagine, this can sometimes create problems. If you are lucky, you get an error message but if you are unlucky your code runs but with an unexpected result.\nLet me give you an example. I always load the dplyr package. Look what happens when I use summarize to calculate the mean sepal length by species.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#&gt; Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Attaching package: 'dplyr'\n#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n#&gt; \n#&gt;     filter, lag\n#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n#&gt; \n#&gt;     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\niris %&gt;% \n  group_by(Species) %&gt;% \n  summarize(sepal_length_mean=mean(Sepal.Length))\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   Species    sepal_length_mean\n#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 setosa                  5.01\n#&gt; 2 versicolor              5.94\n#&gt; 3 virginica               6.59\n\nCreated on 2024-02-21 with reprex v2.1.0\nSay that I then realise that I need the Hmisc package and load it. Look what happens when I rerun the same code as above.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(Hmisc)\n#&gt; Warning: package 'Hmisc' was built under R version 4.3.2\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Attaching package: 'Hmisc'\n#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n#&gt; \n#&gt;     format.pval, units\n\niris %&gt;% \n group_by(Species) %&gt;% \n summarize(sepal_length_mean=mean(Sepal.Length))\n#&gt; Error in iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarize(sepal_length_mean = mean(Sepal.Length)): could not find function \"%&gt;%\"\n\nCreated on 2024-02-21 with reprex v2.1.0\nR is now using the summarize function from the Hmisc package and I get an error because the syntax is wrong. The best way to solve this problem is to use the :: operator.Writing packagename::functionname tells R which package to get the function from.\n\niris3 &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n group_by(Species) %&gt;% \n dplyr::summarize(sepal_length_mean=mean(Sepal.Length))\n#&gt; Error in iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize(sepal_length_mean = mean(Sepal.Length)): could not find function \"%&gt;%\"\n\nCreated on 2024-02-21 with reprex v2.1.0"
