üéâ We're delighted to announce that, new for 2025, we are working in collaboration with Dr Pawel Orzechowski of the University of Edinburgh to offer a **FREE 10-week distance-learning introductory course in NLP with R for NHS employees**!

The course will run from 8th September to 20th November 2025.
In this course, students will explore the fundamental concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and its role in current and emerging technologies. 

This course has been adapted from a postgraduate-level offering from the University and will be run using their bespoke learning platform and a set of fortnightly Teams sessions, culminating in a project presented back to the class in the final session.
